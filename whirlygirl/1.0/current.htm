        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Last Saturday night, while closing register
        three, I had to make change for a twenty. Instead of leaving the drawer open and unoccupied,
        I called Jill to ask if she could bring me change for a twenty dollar bill. Then I clarified and asked if
        she could bring me two tens. Then I said that if she couldn't find two tens that she should bring me
        two fives and one ten. And then I amended that to say that I definitely needed a ten, but that the
        other ten dollars could be made up of two fives, or a roll of quarters, or two rolls of dimes.
        &quot;You know, whatever you have in the change fund that equals twenty dollars.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">When she interrupted me to say, &quot;I got it.&quot;, it was
        a forceful blow. The fact that I was being absolutely ridiculous suddenly came pouring
        over me. I had that acidic guilt melting the lining of my stomach. In my stunned state, I simply apologized and then hung up the phone.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">But thinking back on it, I'm struck by something.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">My situation over the past four and a half years has increasingly
        lowered my expectations of people. I've encountered too many situations in which people just can't imagine or remember
        or understand... and I'm left banging my head against a thick, jagged wall. I've learned to overcompensate
        in every situation, to reduce everything to the simplest terms, to connect the dots and spell it all out.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">What a sad way to define my life.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">More than anything else, this is what must change. I'm determined
        to raise the stakes.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">What are you determined to do today?</font></p>
