        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Dana (my
        teen friend) spent the night last night because Marion
        (co-worker) is out of town on business.&nbsp; We ordered
        in Chinese, switched my shoes from summer to winter, and
        watched <i>the Practice</i>.&nbsp; This morning I got up
        and drove her to school, after throwing on some warm-up
        pants and a hooded sweatshirt.&nbsp; And as I waited in
        line, behind minivans and SUVs, I had a flash of an
        alternative path, a life that could be someday.&nbsp; I
        felt like I was in an episode of <i>Once and Again</i>,
        only not as pretty as Sela Ward.&nbsp; Then, I wished
        Dana a good day, drove back home to get dressed for work
        in my turtleneck, cardigan, long skirt and tough black
        boots - and I was me again.&nbsp; An aimless single
        woman, one who didn't really crave that life glimpsed,
        but could see how easy it would be to slip into, like a
        pair of warm-up pants and a hooded sweatshirt.</font></p>
