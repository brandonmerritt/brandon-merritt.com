        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I just had
        a David Lynch moment. I had just dropped a postcard to
        you in the mail and had gone back to the lobby in the
        building where I work.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">:: DING ::</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">The
        elevator door opened. I entered. I was followed by a man
        wearing a huge jacket, like the suit David Byrne wore in <em>Stop
        Making Sense</em>. I pressed 20 for my floor. The man
        pressed no buttons. He seemed very confident, so I
        assumed that he was going to the 20th floor, too. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">When the
        lights flashed on floor 17, the man who had been very
        still quickly slapped the button for 18. The doors opened
        for the 18th floor. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I said,
        &quot;Wow! That was close.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">He looked
        back at me and said in a French accent, &quot;It's a
        dangerous game.&quot; And got out.</font></p>
