        28 November 1999</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="1" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="1" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">It seems
        that time always eludes me when I need it
        most.&nbsp;Forever just within my grasp, but standing in
        line behind something else more determined to be
        first.&nbsp; Whenever I do get a chance to read, I always
        have a sleepless night. That's not bad.&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">The
        passing of hours and hours of darkness, when the rest of
        the house is quiet, has produced thoughts and revelations
        that follow me still.&nbsp;I thought I would share
        something with you.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I had
        always heard that there isn't a love anywhere as deep and
        abiding as a mother's love for a child.&nbsp;And I always
        thought that was something out of a greeting card or
        someone's imagination, until I had Madison. She rocks my
        world.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">She knows
        my faults and loves me still.&nbsp;I am the most
        important person in her life and she in mine.&nbsp;She
        always has time for me, even though sometimes I don't
        have time for her.&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">She
        snuggles into the bed on a chilly Saturday morning and
        lets me sleep for 5 more minutes.&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">She thinks
        I am the smartest person in the world, especially when I
        explain to her that electricity is what makes Sesame
        Street work.&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">She passes
        out kisses and hugs on request and for no reason other
        that she wanted to.&nbsp;Sometimes, she holds my hand
        just because.&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">She always
        speaks the truth, especially when I don't want to hear
        it. Sometimes, when I see the world through her eyes, I
        am amazed and sometimes, I am ashamed.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">More than
        anything, I am overwhelmed by the enormity of my role in
        her life and how that will shape her future, yet she
        trusts me completely and has no inclination to change
        that fact in any way. She will be what she will be
        because I am her mother.&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Children
        are the soul of the world.&nbsp;Honesty is their backbone
        and love is their motto, they are the purest thing in the
        world.&nbsp;They have no preconceived notion of hate, of
        racism or of all the things that are wrong in the
        world.&nbsp;They love with absolute abandon.&nbsp;What
        we, as adults, do and say now will reverberate in their
        young lives for years and years to come.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">All of us
        have heard one adult accuse another adult of acting like
        a child.&nbsp;Is that a bad thing?&nbsp; Maybe all would
        be right with the world if we did.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">We can
        learn a lot from children.&nbsp;Maybe we should listen a
        little more and talk a little less.</font></p>
