        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Iggy
        Pop. </strong>As Rebecca Gates pulls her guitar strap
        over her shoulder, she tells us that she hopes she isn't
        wearing the same shirt she wore the last time she was in
        town with the Spinanes. &quot;Iggy Pop would never wear
        the same clothes twice... there are certain rock and roll
        truths to uphold.&quot; But tonight is too humbling for
        rock and roll truths. The Middle East downstairs is
        spacious, well-lit, and pin-drop quiet. Amazingly empty,
        void of people not kin to Rebecca's simplistically
        genuine nature.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Take
        them out one by one.</strong> Initially, Rebecca has no
        time for chatter. Atop a virtually empty stage, she
        segues from awkward, quiet endings to new, determined
        beginnings. All the while the audience is unsure as to
        where songs begin and end and soon everything melts into
        a consciousness of pedaled reverb. I recognize upstrokes
        and haunting throatiness from my rotation of Spinanes CDs
        over the last few months, but song titles and proper
        discography escape me.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>The
        DJ wishes for his french kisses.</strong> Halfway
        through, she begins to tell stories. Her drive from
        Chicago inspires a full-body imitation of the jumpsuited
        man working on his VW van. &quot;How sad to think that
        his car breaks down so often that he keeps that little
        jumpsuit-mechanics outfit with him wherever he
        goes.&quot; She gives us a &quot;K-Tel preview&quot; of
        upcoming singles and compilations, singing a line or two
        from each one. &quot;The DJ wishes for his french
        kisses&quot; are &quot;two great lines amid twenty shitty
        ones&quot; that she wrote into a song in under an hour.
        &quot;I don't usually work like that.&quot; I'm happy to
        hear it, knowing that it would take me weeks to master
        just a few of the poignant, grounded moments that color
        her songs with such sophistication.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>More
        requests? Or would you rather I just stumbled through my
        list of covers I don't know?</strong> It's all downhill
        from here. Fans quietly name song titles when she asks
        for requests, and whether she remembers the song or not,
        Rebecca attempts to play them all. She improvises the
        initial drums of &quot;Grand Prize&quot; and sticks it
        out amid mistaken chords, lost beats, and a frustrated,
        &quot;Fuck!&quot;, uttered into the mic halfway through.
        Sharing a &quot;performance moment&quot;, Rebecca
        explains that she suddenly thinks &quot;Kid&quot; written
        on her set list, shorthand for &quot;Kid in Candy&quot;,
        is instead the Pretenders' cover. &quot;Why did I list a
        cover I don't know?&quot; She plays with the kind of
        candid flare that I've only seen Eric Bachmann match.
        Snarling her upper lip, zoning out with a trance-like
        stare, she's in her moment with or without us.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>I
        could go sit backstage for a while, but I'm all alone and
        it smells back there. </strong>She encores. She unbuttons
        her blouse. She steps into a vaudevillian shuffle. She
        closes her eyes. She turns her back. She's gone.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Who
        inspires you?</font></p>
