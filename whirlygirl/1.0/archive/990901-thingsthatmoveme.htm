        tossed around a lot lately.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">A cute,
        convertible car. Crowded, screeching trains. Bumpy,
        fragrant taxis. Stuffy, turbulent planes. Tired, burning
        legs. They conjure sweeping memories of movement, lit
        dramatically with angular reds and softened blues.
        Pictures that seem digitally enhanced by time.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>January
        1995.</strong> I can't help but turn and look back over my
        shoulder once I start down the jetway. I feel as if all
        the weekend's shackled anger is sealing an opaque wall
        between us and I just want one last look. I slow, pivot
        slightly, and casually glance over my right shoulder. But
        he's already gone.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>New Year's
        Eve 1995.</strong> I'm in the middle of the grayest day I've ever
        experienced driving along Interstate 80 in the middle of
        Pennsylvania. The drone of my tires on the asphalt mimics
        the drone of my conscience. I'm caught in a whirlwind of
        New Year's regret, making resolutions at every overpass.
        I resolve to expose the artist within. I resolve to give
        people the benefit of the doubt. I resolve to forget his
        kiss that runs rampant through my memory. I resolve to
        find someone to challenge me. I resolve to enter into new
        relationships aloof and reticent. I resolve to have one
        meaningful conversation in the coming year. I resolve to
        really feel something. Anything.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>March
        1996.</strong> I cry most of the way to Manhattan. In the dimness
        of the bus's passenger light, I scribble the following in
        my journal which makes it onto a postcard sent to him
        days later: &quot;She's fallen into the habit of crying
        on public transportation. The most intensely private
        emotions always seem to connect the right chords at
        strange moments, with watchful eyes and curious minds.
        Two weeks ago it was the steel drum in the Government
        Center T Station. A year ago it was a final good-bye at
        Grand Central Station. Tonight it was a letter filled
        with the purest form of artistry, the outpouring of a
        soul, a very welcomed surprise on a bus bound for
        Manhattan.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>December
        1998.</strong> </font><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I
        look at him with utmost disgust. His face parades the
        false innocence of a mischievous child. His mouth moves
        furiously, spewing a series of pleas imploring me to
        empathize with his plight. The screech of the early
        morning train from the Upper West Side to Park Slope
        becomes my friend, drowning his childish rantings. I'm
        horrified; not only at the ridiculous scene he's creating
        but also at how little time it took to turn me against
        him. After all, just twelve hours earlier my stomach was
        wrought with the anticipation of being face to face with
        him after an absence of two and a half years. How little
        time it takes for us to fall back into familiar patterns.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>March
        1999.</strong> As we walk across Riverside at 95th, he asks me
        what my favorite Dr. Seuss book is. It takes me a minute
        to muddle through titles that automatically spring to
        mind, but I quickly grasp my favorite, the only one I
        owned as a child: <em>The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins</em>.
        At the same time, we pass a trash can blown into the
        middle of the street. I casually pick it up and place
        it back on the curb, tucking the liner back inward.
        These are the only moments of us that linger with me still.</font></p>
