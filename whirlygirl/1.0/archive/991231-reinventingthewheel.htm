        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">He asked
        me where I was going to be this New Year's Eve.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Somewhere
        alone and remote. I don't mesh well with New Year's. I'm
        a creature of regret.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">He didn't
        quite understand.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I can
        distinctly remember one New Year's Eve of my childhood.
        As the clock crept toward midnight, I inched my way down
        the basement stairs... one by one. I was only about
        halfway down when I could hear the sounds of celebration
        coming from the television in our living room. Upon
        realizing that it was midnight, that a year had broken
        off and was suddenly falling into the abyss of the past,
        I began to cry. I felt a year's worth of regret pinned up
        in the pit of my stomach.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Every New
        Year's Eve has been downhill since.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I've tried
        big fun and low key. But that feeling never disappears.
        I'm always that child on the stairwell crying over all
        that is lost.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">But not
        this year.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">People I
        know make resolutions. They revel in clean slates, new
        beginnings, second comings. In the past I could never
        find the strength or the hope to join them.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">But this
        year's different.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I ducked
        out of my life a week ago. Cocooned myself in thought. I
        bought a new coat and a pair of kick-ass boots. My mind
        is racing with revolution. I jumped through my cartoon
        hole and where I come out will be a surprise to even me.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">But I'll
        see you there.</font></p>
