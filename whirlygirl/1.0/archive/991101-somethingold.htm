        called it a relic.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Laine felt
        compelled to find out if I was trapped under something
        heavy.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">In other
        words... it's been a while.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">For me, it
        was like eating some rich, memorable food and then
        suddenly falling prey to stomach flu. Or hearing my
        favorite song at the same time that he decides to walk
        out of my life. Two polar opposites, burned on top of one
        another in my brain, making whirlygirl the last place I
        wanted be.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">The risk
        that comes with publicizing thoughts and ideas and
        wonders is something I was aware of, but hadn't tasted
        until a few weeks ago. I post the most cryptic phrases and
        allow you to riddle with them. I stroll backwards through
        journals and postcards, publishing the pure intensity of
        moments that sting less after considerable time.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">And you
        interpret.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I'm
        reminded of senior rhetoric classes and reading a copy of
        Gibran borrowed from the library. &quot;No message can be
        received in the same way it was intended.&quot; Instead
        it's forced through the individual's magnetic field of
        perspective and history and insecurity. And it comes out
        jumbled, like the teacher's voice in the <em>Peanuts</em>
        cartoons. And it's not what I was trying to say.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">But it's
        no less valid.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">And that's
        something I've been thinking about these last two weeks.
        Just how valid you are... and how cruel I can be. And
        what a risk this honesty is.</font></p>

        you thinking?</font></p>
