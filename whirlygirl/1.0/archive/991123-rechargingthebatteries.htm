        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">When I
        think of Thanksgiving I always think of that time in my
        life. Drinking with Sphinx on Thursday nights. Making the
        Dean's List. Holing up in my tiny Stadium single. Sitting
        at my grandmother's hospital bedside on a first-snow
        afternoon. Reading <em>Generation X</em> for the first
        time under the fluorescent hospital hallway lights.
        Receiving all those letters from Brian.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">He sat in
        a large Arlington, Virginia house miles away from home
        and wrote out my future feelings. He connected to me, as
        you would connect to a ghost of your previous self. He
        scrawled his wisdom and encouragement onto his last pages
        of Ohio State stationary, which appeared in my 1318
        mailbox two days later, encased in priority mail envelopes.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">One thing
        he talked about was coming home for the holidays. He said
        it was one thing to drive an hour or two to see family
        that you just saw a few weeks before. But it was quite
        another to book a flight, step onto a plane and put your
        life on hold for an extended weekend. To fall into the
        well of familiarity and unconditionality that you didn't
        even know you craved. And ultimately, to recharge your
        batteries.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I couldn't
        fully understand what he meant until I moved to Boston.
        But with each passing year that I spend alone in my tiny
        studio apartment, I look forward to Thanksgiving more and
        more. It's the ultimate escape: a plane ride, a secret
        hide-away and a feeling of safety and comfort. It softens
        the edges that build up through endless amounts of
        independence, like checking off antialias to blur the
        sharpness of text.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">So I'm
        going home, amid the connections and confusion and chaos
        of holiday travel. But as soon as I step onto the jetway,
        I'm leaving this hard shell behind to let the gentle
        warmth soak into my skin, recharging my soul.</font></p>
