        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">What a
        bizarre thing cell phones are. I haven't even had mine
        activated yet and it's already bewildering to me. My
        calling plan has all these ridiculous rules, like if I
        want to place a call outside of my local calling area I
        have to program it 30 minutes before I leave my
        apartment. I drive through three different calling
        areas just to get to and from work everyday. I can't
        think of anything less convenient. And last night when I
        called the customer service center to activate my phone, I waited on-hold
	for 20 minutes only to have the phone finally ring
        and someone promptly hang up on me. Another customer service
        success story.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Yesterday
        Nancy's husband, Stephan, accidentally pressed the
        preprogrammed number for their house on his cell phone
        while he was out at lunch with associates. Nancy, Todd,
        and I spent the afternoon in a three-way phone call to
        their answering machine listening to this recorded
        conversation. It reminded Nancy of a story she heard
        about a woman who was car-jacked and just dialed 911 from
        her cellular phone and let the operators listen to her
        saying things like, &quot;Please let me out of the car.
        Why are we driving North on I-95? Just pull over at exit
        28 and let me out.&quot; Nancy said she would have never
        thought of doing that and I said that I probably would
        have. But then Nancy reminded me that my phone wouldn't
        even work unless I programmed it ahead of time. I
        suggested that if someone does attempt to car-jack me, I
        could just ask them politely to come back in 30 minutes.
        Intense cackling followed.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Sometimes
        I don't even realize how funny the things are until I repeat
        them to my friends and they begin to laugh uncontrollably.
        And then it hits me: my parents say funny things.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">For
        instance, it was about a month ago that my parents announced that
        they bought me this cell phone. When I asked why, my
        mother reminded me that sometimes I &quot;drive all the
        way to Albany in the middle of the night on bologna-skin
        tires.&quot; When I repeated this to Todd and Nancy,
        they couldn't stop laughing. And then it immediately
        became part of our vernacular, like when Todd said
        yesterday, &quot;Kristen, can you give me a ride to work
        tomorrow? I'm having my bologna-skin tires
        replaced.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">So since I
        was driving today, it was Todd's responsibility to blow
        the </font><a href="990618-body.htm"

        bubble kisses</strong></font></a><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2"
        face="Arial"> on the way home. When we got stranded in backed-up traffic exiting the Pike in
        Newton, Todd used the opportunity to blow bubbles
        directly at the drivers of the cars on our right. We
        couldn't stop laughing at everyone's lack of enthusiasm
        for our tiny bubble greetings. One woman looked directly
        at Todd and when he blew her a steady stream of magic
        bubbles, she turned abruptly to stare straight ahead,
        refusing to make any additional eye contact with him. Todd
        thought that maybe she wasn't ready for that kind of
        commitment. &quot;It's not you, it's me,&quot; he said
        and sent me into more spasms of laughter.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I've
        decided that when the car-jackers do come for me, I'll
        greet them with bubbles. If this afternoon is any
        indication, it will definitely scare them away. And then
        I won't have to worry about my cell phone's ultra-limited
        calling range.</font></p>
