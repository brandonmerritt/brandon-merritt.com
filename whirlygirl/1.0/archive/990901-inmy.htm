        It's been a while. Hi. How are you? I've been hard at work the past few days trying
	out some new code"y" things. Links, you'll no doubt notice right away oh-perceptive-one, are no longer underlined,
	but instead bold and colored. Not only that, but if you're using IE (because I haven't got all the Netscape kinks worked
	out yet) they <em>change</em> color when you hover over them, much
	in the same way Todd <em>hovers</em> over me when it's 11:58am and time for lunch. Anyway, off track again. Enjoy.</font>

        It's that time again when U-Hauls permeate the streets of
        Boston... September 1, when every lease ends in a college
        town. Every morning Todd tells me about the selections of
        carpets, futons, and halogen lamps that litter the
        sidewalk in front of his apartment, anyone's for the
        taking... and my question: what is so inherently
        unlovable about futons and halogen lamps?</font></td>
