        So LA Michael is part of the Screen Actor's Guild
        nominating committee this year... and in addition to his
        golden ticket to see any movie he wants for free at any
        time, he also has studios mailing him videos of current
        films like <em>Magnolia</em>, <em>The Talented Mr. Ripley</em>,
        <em>Being John Malkovich</em>, and <em>Sweet and Lowdown</em>.
        And because he's the best friend a girl could have, he's
        loaning them out to me. I told Marny about it and now she
        wants to join the Screen Actor's Guild, not to be an
        actor, but on the chance that she could get to see free
        movies, too.</font></td>
