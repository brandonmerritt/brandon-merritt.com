        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Nancy
        brought gobstoppers into work today to share with the
        rest of us. It's been a long time, and clichéd as it
        is... they seemed smaller than I remembered. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Remember
        how much noise they make in their self-dispensing box? I
        rattled them around and peered in the small opening to
        glimpse the bright shiny reds and yellows and deep
        purples... like a VW dealership lot on the sunniest day
        you can imagine.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">And after
        the candy coating wore off, the little gob stuck to the
        side of my cheek like those velcro paddle/ball games...
        just like it did when I was a little kid. The nostalgia
        rush... unbelievable.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">At some
        point today, I accidentally said &quot;bobstopper&quot;
        instead of &quot;gobstopper&quot; and I told Todd that
        &quot;bobstoppers&quot; are actually the sister-candy to
        gobstoppers, except they have magic powers when you eat
        them... like Mentos. In this case, as the name implies,
        by popping a &quot;bobstopper&quot; in our mouths we
        could stop the wrath of Bob, our evil nail-clipping boss.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">At lunch
        under the bright warm sun, over a feta and onion pizza, I
        enthused about the commercials for
        &quot;bobstoppers&quot;. I'm trapped in my weekly meeting
        while Bob drones on and on when suddenly I get an idea
        (which is noticeable by some dorky grin I don.) I take out
        my box of &quot;bobstoppers&quot; (careful to fully
        display the product's logo) and pop one in my mouth.
        Suddenly, Bob melts into a puddle like the Wicked Witch
        of the East (or is it West?) and I smile enthusiastically
        at the camera, make an over-exaggerated thumbs-up and
        smartly hold up the box for proper product placement.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Todd and I
        decided that all of the &quot;bobstopper&quot; commercial
        spots would be inherently similar, except of the method
        of Bob's &quot;stopping&quot;. I suggested that in one he
        could be sucked out of the room with a vacuum-like force.
        Todd said these variances reminded him of PowerPoint
        slide transitions. Wipe right, checkerboard, swivel.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I think
        we'd augment all the changes in our lives with
        PowerPoint transitions if we could.</font></p>
