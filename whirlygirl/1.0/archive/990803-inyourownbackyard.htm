        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I can't
        remember now whether it was in a letter or while we were
        sitting beside Newman Creek throwing pebbles into the
        water that Jay asked &quot;Can you imagine how
        fascinating it would be to go back in time and watch
        yourself as a child?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">It's
        something I've been trying desperately to do for the past
        couple of days. Always when I'm at my most vulnerable I
        find myself trying to connect with the comfort and safety
        and unconditionality that surrounded me as a child. On
        long drives I will try to sharpen blurred memories or
        retrieve those that have trickled down into impossible
        crevices in order to build up my reserve. To retrieve and
        remember and catalogue before there is no one left to
        remind me.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">And I've
        come to the conclusion that the thing that reminds me of
        my childhood the most is thinking about my backyard.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">It wasn't
        particularly big... a typical suburban-square of a
        backyard, fenced on three sides, bordered on the
        fourth by the house, with gates that took me years to
        figure out how to unlatch and open. But each area is
        distinctive in my mind: the garden at the bottom of the
        hill, the patio off the back porch, the peppermint and
        rhubarb growing behind the garage and the perfumed lilac
        bushes that my mother loves so much lining the fence. And
        some parts act like a magic potion for conjuring up those
        lost childhood memories.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Right
        behind the house was the large tree with the tree swing.
        I can still remember watching Dad climb up the ladder to
        replace the ropes every few years to ensure safe
        swinging. There was an oval dirt patch beneath the swing
        where grass refused to compete with feet pushing
        backwards to gain momentum. Dirt which always supplied
        the freshest ingredients for the &quot;flying
        pizzas&quot; that Darin, Mike, and I would create by
        placing a concoction of mud crust, mud sauce, and mud
        toppings on the seat of the swing, twisting it up as far
        as it could be twisted, and then letting it fly...
        dousing the back of the house in mud and frustrating my
        parents time and time again.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">And there
        was Nick's large dog cage next to the garage, which
        served a more active duty as a prison for younger
        neighbor kids or the headquarters for the
        club-of-the-week. I rack my brain trying to remember one
        instance of Nick being locked into the cage, but can only
        see Crayola markers, notebook paper, and stickers spread
        out on the flat roof of his wooden dog house and smell
        the stale hay and straw from the time I was dared to
        crawl inside.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I can
        remember how Dad kept the aluminum swing set brightly
        painted and in tip-top shape to act as our play house,
        our car, our spaceship, or our picnic area. It could host
        every kid in the neighborhood at once, granting
        individual wishes to climb, sit, hang, swing, or slide.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">But most
        of all, I remember the cherry tree. Branching out low to
        the ground, it was the ultimate climbing tree. I would
        look up from my own perch and barely see Darin and Mike
        obscured by the leaves near the top. Dad says he can
        remember looking at that tree from the back door and not being
        able to count the number of heads peeking out from behind
        the bundles of leaves and fruit. On some days, I'd bring
        a bowl from Mom's kitchen outside and we'd climb into the
        tree to collect hordes of sour cherries, eating as many
        as we threw into the bowl. When I'd take it inside and
        ask Mom to bake a pie, she'd always tell me &quot;You
        kids are going to get worms.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">The night
        before I left home for my freshman year of college, I
        took a walk around the backyard and thought a lot about
        the things that had changed there over the years. The
        cherry tree was gone by then, struck by lightening a few
        years before, and in its place was the memory of a sunny
        spring afternoon spent kissing Matt Dohy in the very same
        spot. The dog cage sat silent and empty, Nick having
        passed away just a month before. But the swing was still
        there... and I climbed onto its seat and pushed off in
        the dirt with my tip-toes to gain momentum.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I once
        asked my mother if she regretted not traveling more
        throughout her life. She told me that some people take
        trips around the world to find what they are looking for,
        but that she had found it in her own backyard. Sitting
        here with tears of loss and nostalgia running down my
        cheeks, I understand exactly what she meant.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">What's in
        your backyard?</font></p>
