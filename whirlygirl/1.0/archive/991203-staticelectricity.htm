        probably know someone who has a baby. And for those new
        parents, it always seems like their top priority is
        keeping the baby's schedule. &quot;Gotta go home and put
        him to bed so that we can keep him on schedule.&quot; or
        &quot;I'd love to see you this afternoon, but that's her
        nap time, and I don't want to wreck havoc on her
        schedule.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I'm
        beginning to think that I have a schedule too. And when I
        deviate just the smallest bit, my life is plain chaos.</font></p>

        think of any other explanation for why I feel the way I
        do.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I feel
        like I'm skimming the surface of my life. There's not
        enough time to dive deep. Not enough attention to catch
        everything. Last week my days felt like my own and now I
        don't even recognize them. I'm only half listening to the
        conversations that include me. And most of the time I
        just end up lost. The punch line is passing me by.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Right now

        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">The air
        here is dryer than I can ever remember. Every time I touch
        my car key to the driver's door lock, I see a tiny blue
        spark jump from one to the other and my body winces from
        the smallest electric jolt. Maybe it's all this static
        electricity hanging in the air that's making it hard to
        move... to get anywhere and feel anything.</font></p>
