        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Somewhere
        in the midst of a second mile on the treadmill Tuesday, I
        began to realize all that has been lost in these past
        four years: challenge and creativity and brain-power-push
        shriveling up from lack of use. It's just been too much
        of a sacrifice.</font></p>

        ago Bruce asked how Seattle plans were coming along. I
        answered that they were in a suspended state. To his
        silence, I replied that I just haven't been terribly
        unhappy lately. He reminded me that this complacency
        is no better than the unhappiness and frustration I've
        felt in the past.</a></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">These
        years were so full of hope. Then squandered. Unanswered.
        Vanished.</font></p>

        that creating the whirly dress above is the most
        challenged he's felt in weeks. Today was filled with
        straws and broken backs. We're too talented and hungry to
        waste away. All of the sudden clean slates don't require
        new cities and we're looking in our own backyards to find
        a way out.</font></p>
