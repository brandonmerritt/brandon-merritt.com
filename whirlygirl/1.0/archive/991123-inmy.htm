        Lately I've noticed things about myself that hadn't
        really hit me before... like the fact that it takes me
        forever to translate a catchy mnemonicized phone number
        into numbers when I'm trying to dial it [exemplified by
        the fact that it took me over 30 seconds to dial
        1-800-NYTIMES this morning]. And I was telling Julia a
        few days ago about how compulsive I am about only making
        one trip from the car to my front door... no matter how
        many grocery bags/ gym bags/ purses/ coffee cups/ CD
        carrying cases/ binders I have to carry. Now we've made a

        My high school Physics teacher, Nate Van Wey, is the best
