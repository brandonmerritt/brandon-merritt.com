        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">20 August

        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">There's
        just something about driving on familiar streets, winding
        my way home below midnight skies, that makes me nostalgic
        for Boston, even before I've left.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Weaving
        through narrow lanes of traffic while the Prudential
        looms over Jamaica Pond, memories of that freezing early
        December morning spent pond-side swim through my mind. I can't believe how long it's been and how much things
        haven't changed.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">And then
        Brookline Street crosses Francis and I know Longwood
        isn't far off. And I think about the first time I fought
        my way through rush hour traffic to get to Mike's room in
        Vanderbuilt Hall. Sunlit glare bounced off the chrome
        trim of impatient, angry cars fighting their way through
        a left turn signal. And there I sat, wide-eyed and
        impressionable, soaking up what I interpreted as
        irrepressible charm.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Approaching
        Mass Ave, the breeze imports the purring of engines and
        emanation of exhaust as dozens of motorcycles and choppers
        make their way around the bend. I follow them up the
        alphabetical crosses of Boylston. Between Gloucester and
        Fairfield they skillfully weave through the normality of
        cars like mine, leaving us in the shadows of our envy. Crossing Dartmouth,
        I begin to notice the pedestrians twisting their necks,
        faces laden with joy and wonder, watching these shiny
        black metallic groups dance along. And as I drive, I
        feel like the omniscient narrator that no one ever thinks
        about... even for a second.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Turning onto the Broadway Bridge, I'm showered by
        water falling randomly from the I93 overpass. The
        droplets cling to my window and magnify the tiny white
        lights strung from the squillions of cranes strewn about
        the Potsdamer Platz-like Big Dig site. And the last thing
        I see before leaving the bridge are the thick lines of trains,
        waiting patiently for life and speed and destination to
        whisk them away.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">And as my
        car glides along the familiar streets near home, the half
        moon catches my attention, tilting over toward the West.
        And suddenly something clicks. And Boston isn't so bad
        after all.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Where do
        you call home?</font></p>
