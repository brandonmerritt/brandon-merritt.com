        often ask me how I find out about the music that I listen
        to... and in this case, I got word of this band from a
        San Franciscan's web log that I read almost every day. I
        think that if I connect with the person, I'll likely
        connect with their musical sensibilities. It's how I
        discovered Tsunami and The Spinanes... the theory has yet
        to be disproved.</font></td>
