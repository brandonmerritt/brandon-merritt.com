        talking to Michael and Jolene's answering machine...
        telling it that I was feeling feathery and smiley
        tonight. The machine must have been surprised as it
        normally only records messages from me sounding red-eyed
        and vampirish.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">But not
        tonight.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">It's dark,
        but glowing. There's a light breeze generated by a
        humming fan across the room. I'm listening through a
        subtle Ani DiFranco to hear the patter of gentle rain.
        Right now I feel like eight months ago: January with a
        new Bret Easton Ellis book, a mysterious man kissing the
        microphone in a small college radio studio, epic poetry
        every evening to a complete stranger inhabiting my soul.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">In my last
        twenty minutes of Friday afternoon captivity, I jumped
        from link to link, like stones across a clear, cold
        river: a slow but deliberate pace. And on the other side,
        I found </font><a href="../graphics/kristen.htm"

        color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial"> waiting for me.
        And like her, I too was sold: her defiant stare,
        slightly-parted lips, clumpy eyelashes. I wanted to touch
        her. Until this moment I had not known what it would feel
        like to want to own a true and original piece of art. But
        now she's there when I close my eyes and I've spent long
        car rides of time trying to imagine her current
        perspective. What's the weather like there?</font></p>

        thoughts and quirky sense of self. So many moments buried
        in more than simple honesty. Part of me is still swimming
        inside those pages, living inside of phrases turned by a
        sparkling magic wand. And this severed sense of self has
        left me feeling light... feathery... smiley.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Just these
        simple thoughts remind me of the astrologial
        compatibility between Aquarius and Leo: &quot;Exist

        nothing more.&quot; I feel that he, out there stringing
        along the highways, may be the only one to truly
        understand me tonight. </font></p>
