        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Crossing
        West over 128 on my way to work this morning was like
        crossing into a void. Rich, white vapor began to cling
        outside my car windows, swallowing jagged rocks and
        barren trees and other innocent cars whole.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Fog
        reminds me of my childhood pictures of New England. Once
        I drove through the fog to get the bookstore on a
        Sunday morning and Michael met me outside the store. I
        told him that before I moved to Boston, I thought every
        day would look like this: sleepy-hollowesque with mist
        seeping into every pore. I was a little disappointed to
        find out I was wrong.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Fog makes
        me hopeful. It gives me artistic license. I create a
        world just outside of my vision: massive mountains that
        line the highway and bigger, better destinations just up
        ahead. On the exit ramp this morning, moving slowly
        toward the tollbooth, I looked southwest to where my
        office always looms overhead, but today it was gone...
        swallowed whole like the rocks and trees and cars.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">A tingle
        of hope.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">This
        morning while driving West into the void, I was thinking
        about how loss cleans our slate and grants us
        opportunity. Tyler Durden clichés were running through
        my brain: &quot;Once you've lost everything, you can do
        anything.&quot; I thought about airports and how missing
        a connecting flight showers me with spontaneity. I search
        the destination monitors to find one more appealing than
        the ticket I'm holding. I even go as far as the gate,
        watch the other passengers, pretend to be one of them,
        pray for the courage to slip off into the void.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">As I let
        my foot off the gas and coasted onto the off ramp at exit
        13, the taillights of fellow cars grew dimmer and dimmer
        until they were completely enveloped by a wall of white.
        I envied them all on their unknown path, embellished with
        romantic expectations and idealistic dreams.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">And hope.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Who do you
        envy?</font></p>
