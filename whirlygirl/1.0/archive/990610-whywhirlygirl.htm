        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">So many
        people can attest to the fact that I took this domain
        naming business very seriously. Laine was forwarding me
        her &quot;cool word of the day&quot; messages and cutting
        articles out of the <em>Times-Picayune</em>. Todd and I
        spent hours in front of Microsoft Bookshelf Basic's
        Thesaurus. It's like deciding on a tattoo or what to get
        on your vanity license plates. And above all, for me it's
        a lot of money to invest in a whim.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">But just
        as the whirly definition says above, most of the time I just feel
        rushed... confused... and out of control. I woke up at
        four in the morning a few nights ago and I couldn't get
        my brain to slow down. I felt like a Salvador Dali
        painting inside, as if the decibels of my restlessness,
        indecision, and paralysis had melted the synapses of my
        brain and everything was blending together. And the term
        whirlygirl came to mind.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">But even
        more importantly... why whirlygirl: the web site?</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Because at
        some point I ceased to be the kind of girl who makes the
        effort to contact those people that drift in and out of
        her mind too frequently to count. A place to put all the
        finely-tuned sentences and random memories and unleashed verbiage
        that litter my life. The words have always been there,
        but now they have a home.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">So come
        in. Stay as long as you like. Visit often. The water's
        fine.</font></p>
