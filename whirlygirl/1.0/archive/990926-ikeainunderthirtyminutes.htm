        talking about living space. Hayley is marching Todd out
        to Newton to look at houses. Erika just had a dining room
        table delivered yesterday. Ramona and Dave are looking
        for a different primary address to compliment their
        weekend house in Maine. Jay is making a swinging bench
        for his balcony overlooking the treetops. Jeremy and
        Kristin are now first-time home owners, offering
        impromptu seminars for those of us who equate buying a
        house to interplanetary exploration. And my boss,
        Michael, flipped through the IKEA catalogue at work on
        Friday afternoon to show me his idea of the perfect
        dresser.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">When I was
        holed up in my windowless Stadium single in college, I
        used to dream about my first apartment. It always looked
        like the apartment where Tom Cruise lived in <em>A Few
        Good Men</em>, no doubt created in the midst of my law
        school/ Washington DC phase. The first floor of a
        brownstone, built-in bookshelves, a bay window in front
        overlooking a tiny, fenced-in garden. And this imaginary
        chair in a small, windowed room: oversized, plush, and a
        wee-bit tattered.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Ever since
        I was small, I've been obsessed with furniture displays.
        I'm mesmerized by the way an entire detailed lifestyle can be
        created in the tiniest space, right around the corner
        from something completely opposite. One evening with
        Michael in LA, we found ourselves near IKEA, half an hour before they closed. Without
        much discussion, we ran into the store and invented a
        game out of thin air. We ran from one living room room
        display to another until we each found a favorite. Next
        it was on to bedrooms. Then offices. Bathrooms. Finally
        kitchens. When, miracle of miracle, we chose the same
        room, we celebrated by living there together for five
        minutes as if it were our very own home. <em>Run Lola Run</em>
        meets The American Dream.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">The
        smallest things turn space into home. For me it's the
        coffee table with a stained-glass top that my mother
        bought at a garage sale. The postcards that hang against
        the wall from clotheslines and clothespins. A cold cement
        floor painted hunter green and doused with random
        splashes of red, periwinkle, and lavender. I can't
        imagine a location scout wanting it for Tom Cruise's next
        film, but it's a zillion humble dreams turned into the
        reality of three-dimensional space. And home.</font></p>
