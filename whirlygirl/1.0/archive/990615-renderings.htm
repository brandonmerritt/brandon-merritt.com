        told me that he mistyped my domain name at first: whirly<em><strong>gil</strong></em>
        instead of girl and sent my imagination </font><font
        color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">&quot;a beautiful
        yellow puffer fish spinning out of control...&quot; It
        wasn't just the imagery that thrilled me, but the fact
        that he took those extra few keystrokes conjure it in my
        mind, too.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Which, of
        course, got me thinking about Michael.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">We all
        have those lifetime-ago friends, people we've known under
        many circumstances, through oodles of misunderstandings,
        multitudes of renderings. And lately, I've just been
        missing one of those earlier versions of &quot;us&quot;.
        The &quot;us&quot; that was proximate, spontaneous, and
        electric. I guess we've held onto the important parts:
        unending comfort and trust; the ability to pick up where
        we left off at any time and under any circumstance; the
        mirrored catalogues of moments that, when sent in a
        random email or left on a simple voice mail, can turn a
        day silly and bright. But there is something in me that
        clings to the days of running to the parked Fiat with its
        top down in the middle of a chance thunderstorm; the
        sheer bliss of me and him and a summer ahead devoid of
        expectations.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I rarely
        share experiences with my friends anymore. We write
        reports and list accomplishments, but when we're
        face-to-face, we spend more time regurgitating the past
        than forging the future. Most of us live our lives
        teetering on the edge of real responsibility, but never
        take advantage of our freedom. There's always an
        obligation, some reason that it can wait, and our lives
        pass by in the interim, without those brilliant souls. I
        just feel too young to be stuck in an endless loop of
        nostalgia.</font></p>
		<p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">In the liner notes
		of Saint Etienne's <em>Good Humor</em>, Douglas Coupland paints
		"a world where nostalgia is beside the point because we all live
		inside a bright glorious present." Can you even imagine? When Jim
		read this a few months ago he said, "A perpetually satisfying present
		is inconceivable." I tend to believe him, though I'd give anything
		to be proven wrong.</font></p>
