        moving back to the States, seemingly to the East Coast,
        in less than three weeks. I've been feeding Kendra
        housing hints for her September/October internship stint
        in Boston. Deb's been articulating all these electronic
        thoughts to me about making things happen in cities
        bigger and better and generally more exciting than
        Boston. And it's got me thinking about location.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Again.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">It's been
        so long since I began dreading my &quot;time&quot; in
        Boston that it takes fierce concentration to conjure up
        the reasons I moved here in the first place. But you
        know, it wasn't really a reason... as much as a feeling.
        It was the crisp November air sauntering along the brick
        sidewalk on Hanover Street. It was warm chowder on that
        brightly sunny but frightfully cold Saturday afternoon on
        the dock behind the Aquarium. It was the thick, smoky
        haze settling between our pints of Guinness at Flann
        O'Briens. All are charmed moments too easily
        swallowed by years of a predictable existence.</font></p>

        chose to move to Boston. I thought the people here were
        going to be more open, creative, liberal, and accepting
        of change. It's the same punchline as our friend, Peter,
        who moved to Seattle a few years back &quot;to escape
        humidity.&quot; As Patrick pointed out, one geographical
        transplant to another, Boston is filled with people who
        got off the Mayflower over 400 years ago and still
        haven't left. Boston is overrun with sleepwalkers (to
        borrow Bruce's perfect term) scarcely opting for change or
        a new idea. Their lack of creativity forces dark, dull
        shades of gray to seep into my imagination and dreams.
        And I'm looking to escape before it gets too cloudy to find
        my way out.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">The West
        is calling, like a siren luring a lost ship, promising me
        oodles of space, fresh narrative, and pleasant lack of
        history. I feel like getting myself uprooted and confused
        and lost, because it will be different. And tough. And
        new.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Maybe it's
        impossible to live day in and day out anywhere and

        that for granted. Right now is about trying to make those
