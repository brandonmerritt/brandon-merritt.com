        face="Arial">When Jim called today he mentioned that his
        brother, Conor, had been hiking the Appalachian Trail
        since March and was going to finish in about two weeks. I
        can't figure out how this fact escaped his emails over
        the past five months but I quickly called up <a
        href="http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/Cabin/7945/"
        target="_blank"><strong>Conor's AT Journal site</strong></font></a><font
        color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial"> to catch up on
        twelve states of hiking. After I'd been reading them for
        an hour or so, I found myself thinking, &quot;Wait? He
        had another zero mile day? Two late starts in a row? Is
        he backpacking or slackpacking?&quot; <br>
        And then reality would come into view again quickly: I
        get winded walking up a few flights of stairs and I'm
        going to criticize Conor for taking a day or two or three
        off in the middle of a six month mountain hike? Am I
        certifiable? </font></td>

        maybe it's just my mood, but the strangest things have
        been making me sad lately... take, for instance, the most
        bizarre one by far: the man who serves the lunchtime
        entrées in the cafeteria at work makes me sad, because
        no one ever stands in his line... everyone's too busy
        getting deli sandwiches or something from the grill and
        he just stands there looking longingly at all the
        customers that have snubbed him. I won't let Todd talk
        about it when we go down to lunch because it makes my
        heart pang with sadness</font></td>
