        Todd generously helped me redesign some of my texty

        Last night Elizabeth Berg came into the store and after a
        brief conversation where I stuttered clumsily and she
        humored me by smiling, I watched her look through the
        fiction shelves. I couldn't imagine what it must feel
        like for her to go into a bookstore and stare up at her
        own books on the shelf.</font></td>
