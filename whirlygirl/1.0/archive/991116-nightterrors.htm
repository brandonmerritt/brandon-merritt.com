        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Early,
        early in the morning on a day last week, the kind of
        morning that is still considered night in some social
        circles, I awoke from a nightmare with the most
        liquid-nitrogen cold terror running through my veins. I
        uprighted myself to a sitting position and took several
        shallow breaths. Everything in my sight was washed in a
        granular slate blue color, illuminated by the street lamps
        pouring through the front window. As I breathed, the
        nightmare rewound and began to play again, this time
        cutting through the reality of my conscious mind. Like
        most nightmares, it wasn't frightening this second time
        around, but instead nonsensical and random.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">But I
        couldn't shake the fear.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I swung my
        feet over the side of the bed and bent down to rest my
        chin on my knees. I tried to make myself small and
        insignificant, to clear my head of the fear that clung
        like low-settling fog.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">When that
        didn't work, I walked over to the bathroom and flipped on
        the overhead light. The light flooded the tiny room and
        the noise from the fan above whirred irregularly, too
        loud for this quiet time of night. I stepped closer to
        look at myself in the medicine cabinet's mirror, my curls
        askew, face framed by L.A. Michael's postcards. And with
        one glimpse I saw something lying just below the surface
        of my blotchy olive skin and peering out from behind my
        glassy, paralyzed eyes.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Candor
        creeps up on my face in moments of extreme vulnerability.
        In that mirror, I saw a face unmasked and it initiated
        more alarm than a lifetime of nightmares. Pure
        realizations flooded my consciousness, volleying back and
        forth in my brain. The justifications and stories and
        perceptions that get me through each day had vanished,
        replaced with an honesty so foreign and unfamiliar. I was
        at ground zero. My chaotic layers peeled and burning at
        my feet, leaving the naked core shivering, unprotected,
        and scared.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I stepped
        backwards, left hand reaching out for the switch to cut
        the power to the overhead light. In an instant I was
        standing amid darkness and quiet again.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I couldn't
        return to bed right away. Instead I curled up on my
        couch, knees to chin, and stared out my window at the
        cars parked in front of my apartment, the leaves that
        were wedged between my flower box and window screen, and
        the few faint stars that loomed over the house across the
        street. And one quiet, realized thought pulsated in my
        head, but refused to materialize. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Until last
        night.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Last night
        I found that thought parading among the grounded
        descriptions and witty dialogue of <em>Miss Wyoming</em>.
        And the fact that Douglas Coupland can flesh out my
        thoughts with unfailing precision is why he continues to
        rock my world.</font></p>
