        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I brought
        yesterday's <em>New York Times Magazine</em> into work
        today to show Todd the &quot;The Times Capsule&quot;
        issue. We turned the static clingy pages and oohed and
        ahhed over its Terminator design and laughed at David
        Letterman's Top Ten list. And then I asked what I
        consider to be an important question that no one seems to
        address:</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Why don't
        we ever get to open a time capsule?</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Apparently
        the first US time capsule was sealed in 1876 by Mrs.
        Charles Deihm (the presentation of her name says it all...) with
        instructions for it to be opened on July 4th 1976 by the
        Chief Magistrate of the United States. As instructed,
        Gerald Ford opened the time capsule on that day to find,
        among other things, a complete tea service.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Surprise.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">The <em>Times</em>
        is inviting the general public, <em>NY Times</em>
        Readers, and American Natural History Museum goers to
        suggest items to be included in their Times Capsule, to
        be opened in the year 3000. Suggestions include butterfly
        hair clips, Pokemon cards, cell phones, bricks, Beanie
        Babies, pens, bar codes, and a video game joystick.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">What's the
        point?</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Half of
        these things will seem like ancient relics in 6 months,
        let alone 1000 years. What inkling will this give future
        generations about our lives on the cusp of the year 2000
        that they couldn't read in a simple volume of a pop
        culture encyclopedia? Is any of this important enough to
        document?</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Look
        around you. Look at all the must-have objects that
        litter your life and ask yourself if even just one of
        them is important to pass on; if it truly defines your
        soul. The black matte electronics. The IKEA furniture.
        Your place setting for ten.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Instead,
        imagine some distant and future relative of yours,
        granddaughter<sup>50</sup>, opening up a simple letter. A
        journal. A photograph album. Your favorite book. Imagine
        the mark that your words and your art and your heart can
        make on someone so far from now.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Back when
        Scott hosted The Random Question Game by email, he asked
        all of us to list the items we'd include in a time
        capsule. I filled mine with books, music, movies, and
        art. Puzzle pieces that lock together to mirror myself in
        this blip of time. Ignoring the technological fact that
        CDs and video won't last longer than 20 years,<strong> </strong></font><a
