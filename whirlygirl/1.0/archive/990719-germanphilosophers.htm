        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">So Laine
        recently fell for a guy because he mentioned over lunch
        that sometimes he just wanted to talk with someone about
        &quot;German philosophers&quot;. When she told me this,
        she was sitting right where I am now, typing away at her
        mentoring paper, trying to squeeze it in before the
        deadline... perhaps even earlier so that we could stop
        for tea on our way up to Maine. I was wandering around
        this studio, basking in the luxury of a free morning with
        no expectations, and her comment nearly made me jump.
        There was one thought going through my mind:</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Exactly.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Not that I
        could even name one German philosopher. In fact, I tried
        right then but could only come up with Martin Heidegger
        as a best guess (later confirmed by my resident-expert
        philosopher, Karl, as being correct... two points.) But
        it was this idea of falling, if ever so slightly, because
        of a random glimpse of someone's intellect that I
        understood so well. It wasn't as if these words tumbling
        out of his mouth casually over lunch gave Laine any
        uncontrollable urges that could result in them being
        asked never to return to the dining establishment. But it
        simply generated enough heat to connect a current of
        possibilities she hadn't realized existed before.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">It happens
        to me too often to count.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I don't
        fall for a square jaws or sulky eyes, though I have been
        known to comment on them from time to time. Instead, I
        fall for a conversation that sends me running to a
        dictionary or a library, with a fire that can only be
        extinguished by learning what I didn't even know existed
        before. I often fall when scouring disheveled personal
        libraries or meticulous CD collections. It's someone who
        quotes my favorite lines from Woody Allen films or
        expresses a distaste for contentment that sends my
        stomach to the trapeze and casts my perspective in a
        different texture. Someone who thinks and lives with
        passion. And not too long ago, it was someone talking
        about Virginie Ledoyen and French cinema on the radio.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Brain
        crushes may not sustain, but they do start something full
        of innocent and giddy promise. They nudge you awake
        painlessly, pass time in gazing speculation, and teach
        you things you never dreamed you'd want to learn.
        Fruition, in most cases, is overrated... but the ride is
        a breathtaking adventure.</font></p>
