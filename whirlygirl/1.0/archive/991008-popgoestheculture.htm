                face="Arial">It was December 11, 1988, and I was
                wearing a gray wool double-breasted suit with a
                highly starched white dress shirt. I had been
                wearing it all day, the collar was digging into
                my neck, and I was getting irritated. I had
                recently finished reading <em>Sons and Lovers</em>
                where there's a character who died from an
                infection he got from wearing a tight, starched
                collar, so I was fixating on it all day and kept
                on mentioning it to people and nobody knew what I
                was talking about.</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF"
                size="2" face="Arial">...Someone introduced us
                and we spoke for a few minutes and then I brought
                up my starched collar/<em>Sons and Lovers</em>
                story. He got it! It was just one of those
                moments where worlds come together.&quot;</font></p>

        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">But think
        about how literature invades our culture and how reading
        one book can lend you a deeper understanding of how we
        communicate. We express ourselves inside metaphors and
        analogies that are lifted from the pages of our dearest
        books. I &quot;talk like a telethon&quot; with Michael,
        post my &quot;desert island, all time, top ten&quot;
        lists on this web site, and often push myself to do
        things for the &quot;fat lady&quot; and because of it you
        get a deeper understanding of what affects me and how I'm
        touched by the words of Coupland and Hornby and Salinger.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I was
        recently rereading part of Alain De Botton's <em>On Love</em>,
        a book I read in 1995, and I was amazed at the references
        that I understood today that I surely glossed over four
        years ago without an inkling of the deeper meaning.
        Think of everything lost in translation, when you simply
        speak the language and not the culture. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Don't
        skim. Pause. Reflect. Inquire. Let yourself sink deeper
        and understand more. For me, it's the difference between
        existing and living.</font></p>
