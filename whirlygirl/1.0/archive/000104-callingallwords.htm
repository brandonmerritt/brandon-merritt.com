        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">At the
        risk of sounding as pretentious as James Lipton, host of
        Bravo's <em>In the Actor's Studio</em>, I'd like to ask: </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">&quot;What
        is your favorite word?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Or words.
        Random, three-point, obscure, multi syllabic, dirty,
        foreign... in short the sky's the limit here. I want to
        know your favorite words. Words that intrigue you. Words
        that make you laugh. Words that feel good as they tumble
        out of your mouth.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">A few
        years ago on a wintry night, I took out my journal and
        began to write down words that seemed knit up in my
        existence... words that I just plain love. Pages and
        pages of just words, random lists and strings of words
        falling one after the other, constructing no pattern,
        making no sense.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">A while
        back, when I couldn't wait to escape to a new city with a
        clean slate, I stopped working to make my environment
        artsy and fun. My apartment felt like a tiresome cell. My
        fun &quot;Pollock&quot;ized cement floor became riddled
        with scrapes and scuffs and I couldn't think of investing
        the energy to repaint it. My apathy robbed me of new
        ideas. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">But
        driving back to Boston on Saturday night, my head was
        consumed with improving my living space. Because I'm
        comfortable here. Because I've found the courage to live
        with the imperfections of this city rather than flee it
        for impossible ideals. Because I'm going to stay... at
        least for a while longer.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">And I
        remembered that list of words. And the feeling it gives
        me when I run across it randomly while fishing for a
        quote or a recorded moment. And suddenly I had a plan.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I'm going
        to paint my words... and your words onto my floor. All
        sizes. All colors. Chaotic and random... our words will
        speak volumes.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">So unwind.
        Think quickly and creatively. Mail them in massive lists
        or little by little. Help me paint a new foundation. </font></p>
