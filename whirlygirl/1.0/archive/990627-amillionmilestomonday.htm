        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Some time
        ago when I was living in Ohio, the Illinois Chamber of
        Commerce initiated a televised ad campaign for Chicago
        with the tag line, &quot;a Million Miles to
        Monday.&quot; My mother told me once how charmed she
        found this phrase to be. I have to agree. And after the past two days,
		it's exactly how I feel.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Complete
        and utter idleness consumed me on the Cape this weekend.
        And not the kind of idleness where guilt is the
        overriding theme, because every ounce of fret and worry
        that envelops my working week and twisted life was left
        on the Northern side of the Sagamore Bridge last Friday
        night... caught in the webs and nets that hung from its
        rafters... abandoned like the construction there.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">And I was
        free.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Free to
        slow my daily whirl to a screeching halt, lose track of
        the thoughts that pester me in the middle of the night,
        and swim inside of books and people and a vast expanse of
        azure skies. Leisure took hold and refused to let me
        think outside the Now... my expectations rendered
        useless, wilting from lack of proper attention. The
        relaxation was overwhelming. Even now, back in my untidy
        apartment, returning my things to their original habitats
        and making coffee to ice for a week's worth of mornings,
        things are moving slowly. In my mind I'm back under the
        nearly-full moon over Forest Beach with the
        cool sand between my toes. And what can be stressful
        about that?</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">On my
        postcard from Thailand, Jim wrote about living in his
        bungalow on the beach in Koh Samui: his walks into town
        in the evening; his days full of swimming, reading, and
        recovering from the night before. He told me of the
        people he'd met that had been living a similar lifestyle
        for months but that it was hard for him to imagine that
        much leisure. And it got me thinking about the fine line
        between life and leisure, how mutually exclusive the two
        sometimes seem, and how difficult it is to marry them in my mind.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Just
        before I moved to Boston to take my place within the
        first stringent working weeks of my life, there was
        another television commercial, this time for Discover
        Card. It featured an instrumental version of "Fly Me to the
        Moon" and the image of a man and a woman driving in a
        convertible car on a winding, sunlit road. The voice-over
        said, &quot;Ten days of vacation. Twelve holidays.
        Fifty-two Saturdays. Fifty-two Sundays.&quot; And it hit
        me: this is what my life was going to be reduced to from
        this point forward for as far into the future as I could
        imagine. I swallowed hard and began to dream of ways to
        unseal this fate. And I'm still dreaming.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">How do we
        capture those stray moments that fall into the cracks of
        our lives? Five whole days pass while I pray for speedy
        deliverance into the weekend. The anticipation of an
        upcoming vacation absorbs months of imagination. The
        majority of a year is spent separate from the kind of
        calm and contentment that I experienced this weekend. And
        I expend small, quiet, candle-lit moments, like this one,
        wondering why.</font></p>

        your weekend?</font></p>
