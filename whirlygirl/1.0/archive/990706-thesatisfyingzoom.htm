        two unread weeks of the Sunday Times abandoned under my

        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Let's
        begin with the fact that about 15 minutes ago I nearly
        jumped out of my chair... every hair standing on end...
        because without warning my new purple whirlywriter pen
        spontaneously activated itself and began to thrash and
        whirl around my writing table, slapping against the
        Adrienne Rich book that I pulled off the shelf earlier
        tonight. I knew it was just begging to whirl around an
        empty, white sheet of paper. And so, like a tiny
        sprite-like fairy, I granted its wish and post it here
        for you to admire.</font></p>

        she couldn't resist the oversized purple pen that said
        &quot;whirlywriter&quot; on the side... and she snuck to
        the register and bought it for me before I even had a
        chance to lay eyes on it. Once we loaded it up with a AAA
        battery last night, we took turns whirling it around junk
        mail envelopes and the backs of receipts. I took it to
        work today and Todd promptly saturated our small cube
        with that dentist-office drilling sound. He hailed it the
        cure for my helpless tornado whirlwind drawings. It's
        like a magic wand.</font></p>

        an &quot;encounter&quot; laced with &quot;love potion

        kayak guide pitted against &quot;Shh!&quot; the Harbor
        Seal, protector of nature's peace and quiet; and Laine's
        graceful &quot;sparkler&quot; ballet coupled with a
        facial expression combining utter fear with sheer joy.
