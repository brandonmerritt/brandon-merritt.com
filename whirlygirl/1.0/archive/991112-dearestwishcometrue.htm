        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Today when
        I got to the bookstore there was a book in my mailbox. I
        thought maybe it was something that Bookstore Michael
        wanted me to borrow and read. I couldn't really puzzle it
        out until I stepped a few inches closer to see the spine.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial"><em>::
        Miss Wyoming ::</em></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">:: Douglas
        Coupland ::</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">:: Advance
        Reader's Edition ::</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">A
        &quot;galley&quot;, as they say in the industry.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">For me, it
        was like heroine. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I grasped
        it with both hands and literally ran into Michael's
        office to thank him. But he wasn't there. His day off. It
        would have to wait. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Instead I
        walked upstairs and ran into Katie. I told her about the
        book and she explained that she was actually supposed to
        give it to me the night before when we got together to
        see <em>American Beauty </em>but she forgot... and
        therefore she put it in my mailbox. I explained to her
        how happy the book made me. She told me that was just the
        least of it. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">:: The
        least of it. ::</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">She said
        that Michael wanted to tell me the rest. But I was
        already off and running with questions? &quot;Is he
        coming to the store? Is he coming to the Brookline store?
        Is he reading here?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">No answer.
        Just a smile. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Finally
        she said, &quot;That's not all.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">:: That's
        not all. ::</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Then the
        words came fluttering out of her mouth and they were
        spiraled in these glittery hues that suddenly started to
        turn dark around the edges. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Michael's
        giving you the day off. Jim is making the arrangements.
        You're going to spend the day hanging out with him.&quot;
        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">:: hanging
        out with him ::</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">:: Douglas
        Coupland ::</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">:: omigod
        ::</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">What
        followed was a scene of squeals and zero balance, a
        squillion times worse than the infamous
        &quot;play-doh&quot; incident from last year's holiday
        swap. Katie made me promise to duplicate this intensity
        when Michael tells me the exact same news a few days from
        now.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I doubt it
        will be a stretch for me.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Already
        I'm trying to think of any number of words that I could
        possibly use to string together to form a coherent
        sentence in the presence of Douglas Coupland. None come
        to mind.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Life
        doesn't get this good just every day. It takes practice.
        And frustration. And time. And grace. And wading through
        an inordinate amount of disappointment. And even then it
        doesn't come close. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">But
        yesterday mine did.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">And it was
        perfection. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I've
        heightened this to its ultimate dramatic conclusion. I'm
        kind of numb. I feel dizzy. Giggles keep getting caught
        in my windpipe... choked back down by the rolling nausea
        in my stomach.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">And just
        Tuesday I was speaking on the telephone with L.A. Michael
        and he interrupted me to say that I was exactly like a
        character in a Douglas Coupland novel. And I paused for a
        beat and said, &quot;Yes, but I don't wear Capri
        pants.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">But things
        can change.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">What is
        your dearest wish come true?</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">biggest
        kiss...</font></p>
