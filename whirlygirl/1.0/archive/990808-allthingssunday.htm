        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I would
        bet that Mike still hates Sundays simply because of their
        inevitable segue into the nightmares that Mondays bring.
        I was thinking about his distaste for all things Sunday
        this morning when I awoke to thick shades of gray and an
        unlikely quiet. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Wrapped in
        an airy cotton quilt, my first bit of consciousness asked
        what season it is, something I tend to never remember
        when I wake anymore. And then I realized it was Sunday
        morning. And then I thought of Mike. And much to his
        likely dismay, I jumped out of bed eager for the calm
        unfolding that most Sundays bring.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I made
        myself take a shower and make my bed before retrieving my
        Sunday <em>Times</em>. Dreaded tasks and their handsome reward. I
        restarted a Sunday newspaper subscription a few months
        ago when I suddenly realized that I was relying
        exclusively on </font><a

        size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Todd</strong></font></a><font
        color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial"> reading the three
        newsbriefs in the right column of Yahoo's search engine
        to me each day to stay informed. My decision to receive <em>The
        New York Times</em> came about as the resulted
        combination of John Guare's <em>Six Degrees of Separation</em>
        and the memory of a late Saturday night/Sunday morning on the Upper East Side
        with Melanie, Phil, and Chuck discussing a <em>Times
        Magazine</em> article about artichokes. In other words,
        the irresistible, glistening cliché of it all.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Sundays
        are about routines that I never have time for during the
        week. Hot tea with milk and sugar, even on the hottest
        summer day. Perfecting my onion, broccoli, and cheddar
        omelet. Curls allowed to dry naturally while I read. When
        company stays, it's off to Soundbites for endless cups of
        coffee and smoothly-whipped, garlic homefries. Afternoon
        movies at Kendall Square. Moon rises at Castle Island.
        Star gazing from the Scituate jetty. Sundays are a
        perfected day of real life before the working week consumes me
        once more.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">My most
        memorable Sundays are spent in isolation, enjoying
        warm light on the periphery from where I stand in the
        shadows. A Sunday that begins in </font><a

        and writing.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Right now
        &quot;Sunday&quot; by The Spinanes plays over and over in
        my mind and on my stereo. I can see the wind gently
        knocking its way through the plants and trees outside my
        door. I have an endless list of options, a nonexistent
        bank account, and a craving for adventure. I toss
        thoughts and ideas back and forth in my mind, happy for
        today's freedom and uncertainty. Sundays can do that to a
        person.</font></p>
