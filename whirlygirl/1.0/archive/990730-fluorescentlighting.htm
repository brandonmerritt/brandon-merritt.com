        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Jim.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I
        mentioned a few weeks ago that Jim is moving back to the
        States soon. Actually this weekend. Taipei, the city I
        jokingly use as shorthand for the furthest distance I can
        imagine, is the city he's called home for just about two
        years. Always twelve hours ahead in the future...
        floating amid perplexing time configurations... day to my
        night. But my romantic notions of having a friend on the
        other side of the earth will come to a screeching halt
        when he steps off that jet at JFK.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">It's hard
        to imagine someone willingly returning to a life that I
        so desperately want to escape. In his last post he spoke
        of bank accounts and credit cards and cars... ingredients
        of the American Dream. I agree with his reasons for
        leaving Taipei now... but hope that he doesn't settle
        into the banality he's managed to escape thus far: 9 to
        5, profit sharing, fluorescent lighting, servers that
        scan your incoming email, the company picnic, ID badges,
        swipe cards, and particle board walls that seal you
        inside a quiet nightmare.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">The dreadful fate of the middle
        class: enough money to ward off natural chaos, not enough
        to generate an exciting simulation. Everyone I've talked
        to lately can hear the droning, white-noise hum of their
        lives right now, lulling them to sleep. I dream of lying
        down to sleep in a field of poppies and waking up closer
        to Oz. I dream of days that begin at 4:45pm and end just
        after breakfast. I want someone to shake this small and
        boring snowglobe to create a miracle of motion.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Jim says
        I'm good at my angst. But most of the time, I just feel
        numb... distracted and hollow, trying to raise some sense
        of panic. Even as I write this, it's hard for me to
        string together honest, meaningful thoughts. I look back
        on my laughter with friends just a few hours ago and
        wonder why the night took such a somber turn. It's the
        hopelessness of <em>not</em> feeling that has crept under my skin, making me pimply and uncomfortable. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">And it
        makes me worry about my jet-set friend, wishing for him
        to escape a similar fate. To return, but to rebuff this
        humming... so deafeningly quiet.</font></p>

        you want to escape?</font></p>
