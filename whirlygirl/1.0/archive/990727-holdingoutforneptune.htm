        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">At this
        very moment I'm wondering if I could secure a temp job as early as tomorrow morning.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I'm
        sitting quietly in the &quot;cube&quot;. Todd is meeting
        with a consultant on his half of our workspace and I'm
        eavesdropping on their conversation. The sun has shifted
        Westward, making the cars in the parking garage that I
        overlook sparkle.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Basically,
        I'm bored to tears.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I've been
        disconnected from our network, from the internet, and
        from email because of a virus contracted by my PC.
        Suddenly I'm rendered useless because of someone else's
        stupidity and panic. My seether is just under the surface
        dreaming of all things drastic. And the idea of holding
        out 'till January 31<sup>st</sup> feels like a bike-ride
        to Neptune.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">James
        recently quit his job as a business systems analyst with
        an insurance company after five-plus years. He used to
        talk about it as if it were prison, like Morgan Freeman
        in <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em> describing what it
        means to be &quot;institutionalized&quot;. And I, too,
        hear these words echo in my head:</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Get
        busy living... or get busy dying.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Last night
        in bed, deprived of sleep by the churning of frustrations
        and dissatisfactions. I had to consciously force myself
        out of a hopelessly negative train wreck, only to have it
        creep up on me again and again. I feel pushed to some
        mysterious, cliff-like threshold. Every irrational,
        passionate ounce of me wants to dive off, even if I can't
        see the water below.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">On
        Saturday night I passed an ominous black door on 11<sup>th</sup>
        Street between 1<sup>st</sup> Avenue and Avenue A that
        had simple silver lettering that spelled out:</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2"

        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2"
        face="Arial">I stopped for a moment and imagined opening
        that door and being washed of all the potential energy in
        my life. Right now my miracle isn't descriptive or
        conclusive, but it's definitely kinetic.</font></p>
