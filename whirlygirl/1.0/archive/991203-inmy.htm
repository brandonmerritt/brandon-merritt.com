        &quot;There are rare moments when watching a film for the

        cinematic event. Such an experience occurred over the

        Mark (my brother) and Carrie (my sister-in-law) are
        driving up to Boston to pick up the old Sable this
        weekend. Though I L.O.V.E my new car to pieces, part of
        me is sad to say good-bye. This was the car of high school
        car pools to Amahl and the Night Visitors rehearsals and
        spontaneous college road trips and fateful chance
        encounters. With my new, shiny, teeny-tiny del Sol, I
