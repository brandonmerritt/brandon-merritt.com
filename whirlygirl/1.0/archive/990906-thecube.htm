                was sitting in my cubicle, affectionately named
                the veal-fattening pen. I wasn't getting much
                done and was staring at my IBM clone surrounded
                by a sea of Post-it Notes, rock band posters
                ripped off construction site hoarding boards, and
                a small sepia photo of a wooden wailing ship,
                crushed in the Antarctic ice, that I once found
                in an old <em>National Geographic</em>.</font><p
                align="right"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2"
                face="Arial">...Douglas Coupland, <em>Generation
                X</em></font></p>

            </tr>

        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Upon
        entering the workspace that Todd and I share, the only
        question is which item you'll ask about first. You see,
        the fact that &quot;the cube&quot; will stir within you
        both fascination and wonder is the surest thing I can
        imagine.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">The world
        map that covers the entirety of the corner where Todd's
        desk meets mine may quickly draw you in, as might the
        &quot;game-pieces&quot; with our names and pictures on
        them, strewn about countries and continents with a
        haphazard toss. Or maybe you're the kind of keen observer
        that will notice that Todd has penciled in our own
        building operations go-to-guy, Stan Ozereko, among the
        long list of &quot;...stan&quot; countries near Russia.
        Either way, your brow is sure to wrinkle quizzically.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Or let us
        explain, in great detail, with unbridled enthusiasm, the
        origin of each of the McDonald's Fried Apple Pie boxes
        that you'll see pinned to textured wall. The nuances of
        the Berlin and München apfeltasche. The striking
        similarity between Sweden's &quot;Varning: Het Fyllning!&quot;
        and our well-tested theory that the entire Swedish
        language really sounds like English spoken with the
        Swedish Chef Muppet's thick accent.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Perhaps
        the day you visit the cube will be a lucky one and HVAC
        will be eagerly flooding each vent with
        sick-building-syndrome air. If so, you won't be able to
        ignore the billowing capes on the three superhero Pez
        dispensers. You'll step closer to inspect these gauzy
        cape creations; but, before you can guess the texture,
        you'll hear an authoritative whisper in your ear,
        &quot;wedding invitation tissue paper.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">You'll
        find yourself pondering the fate of the pink
        marshmallow-peep bunnies. Just one simple question and
        you'll encounter a historical, yet scientific, account of
        their soft-to-hard-back-to-soft phenomenon over the last
        three and a half years. The ugly details of past
        &quot;staleness&quot; tests may be hard to hear, first
        standing on them and then (*gasp*) running them over with
        my car in the back parking lot. But happiness will abound
        at the end of it all when chatter turns to the brilliant
        creation of pink Play-doh prosthetic ears.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">You'll be
        sure to quickly realize that one visit to this cube isn't
        enough to satiate your curiosity. After all, exhibits
        revolve and expand at the blink of an eye. A tasteless
        jar of ice cream sprinkles can turn into a &quot;white
        rabbit&quot; trophy in less than an hour. And one can't
        predict the genius of how a simple two-week old glass of
        water turns into a conversation piece when the following
        Post-it is attached:
        &quot;www.humidifiers-on-a-budget.com&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">But don't
        just take my word for it. Come experience it for
        yourself. Sit with us among the chaos and the crayons and
        the autographed picture of Omar Vizquel and ponder life's
        overwhelming mystery: &quot;We get paid for this?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Where do
        you work?</font></p>
