        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Tonight is
        candlelit. The latest Pedro the Lion EP is loud enough to
        simulate a live performance in my tiny studio apartment.
        I'm waiting on a call from Mom and Pops. The Times is
        strewn about my scratchy sofa. It's after 9pm and I
        haven't eaten dinner.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">In other
        words, a typical Sunday.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I spent
        the afternoon cleaning out the cubby hole next to my bed.
        The same hole that produces an atypical skylight in my
        basement studio. The minuscule hole where my nephew,
        Steven, and then Todd claimed to be the place in my
        apartment they'd most like to sleep. The only problem-
        it's always been littered with boxes and bags filled with
        old television antennas and college photographs and
        nearly 10 years worth of letters. Until today, when I
        finally got up the nerve to tackle and tidy the entire
        lot.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">One of the
        first things I stumbled upon was the quote book from my
        sophomore year in college. Strips of paper pasted on the
        pages of a simple blank book, which puzzled together,
        would produce several wall-length sheets of butcher paper
        on which my friends and I would record all the phrases
        that made us laugh the hardest. No subject left
        unturned... no acquaintance left unscathed. Everything
        from Joe's honest confession: &quot;And you tell them
        that you love them... and sometimes you do.&quot; to
        Matthew's excuse for missing O-Chem class: &quot;It would
        just have been very uncomfortable to see her [our
        teacher] vertically four hours later.&quot; to Aly's
        Spring Quarter running joke: &quot;What do you call a man
        you don't know? Nice.&quot; I couldn't believe how
        quickly I remembered the exact context of each quote and
        how vividly the recollections of each person sprang to
        mind. I normally can't even remember what I had for
        dinner the night before, but it seems that these words
        inked with Crayola markers onto cheap white paper are a
        direct passport to dozens of people and moments I thought
        were long forgotten.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Then the
        letters. Hundreds of them. Grouped by sender and tied
        with green and blue ribbons. I stumbled across a list of </font><a
        href="../cameos/990711-janet-birthdaywishes.htm"
        target="content"><font size="2"
        face="Arial"><strong>birthday wishes</strong></font></a><font
        color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial"> from Janet and an
        excerpt from the personals from Michael (circled:
        &quot;Is anyone else in LA looking for something real?
        26, only slightly neurotic, Real World finalist ISO
        someone to make my life like the movies.&quot;) It was
        like wading in a forgotten ocean saturated with reminders
        of just how cool my friends are.</font></p>

        face="Arial">A</font></a><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2"
        face="Arial">nd then I sat still for an hour or two and
        reread all the letters from him. And I cried... because
        he was so lovely but is now so lost among old addresses
        and rumors and falling out of touch with those who knew
        us both. And I began to scheme of ways to fall back into
        his life; of searching him out and picking up where we
        left off. Yet I'm all too aware of my attachment to the
        romance of what's past and how the reality of a future
        could never hope to compete. But it doesn't stop me from
        thinking of him tonight. And wondering.</font></p>
