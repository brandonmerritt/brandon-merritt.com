        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Todd drove
        me home, which gave me the opportunity to blow bubbles
        out the car window to kiss all of our neighboring cars
        with soap bubble splotches. It's one of those teeny tiny
        bottles of bubbles that you get at weddings (thanks Karl
        and Lori!) and most people throw away, but I find them to
        be the most convenient carrying size... and now they go
        everywhere with me. We slithered through the madding rush
        hour crowd near South Station where skaters wore shoes on
        their hands and a man stood upon a soap box with a R E P
        E N T sign and no one got angry at me about their soap
        bubble kisses, not even the bright, shiny, important
        Grand Cherokees and Lexuses. And a gray-haired man inside
        a crane near the gargantuan big dig hole on A Street
        tooted his little crane horn, brought his fingers to his
        lips, and blew <em>me</em> imaginary bubbles.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">What can I
        say? It was magical.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Todd used
        to work in another group... in another building... and he
        whiled away his days writing me side-splitting notes about
        manuals bound with kite string and jury duty haikus. And
        on occasion he would write lists: &quot;top ten Far Side
        comics that begin with the word, 'Sadly...'&quot; or
        &quot;top ten ways life at MEDITECH is similar to life as
        an African bushman.&quot; I collected them in a file and
        named it &quot;ranter&quot; and Todd started calling me
        his authorized biographer.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">But now we
        share a tiny cube. And instead of writing poetry, Todd
        rolls over to my desk a few thousand times a day and
        spins the whirly things on my desk and helps himself to
        Altoids or Pez or Big Babol and promulgates his witty
        remarks. But sometimes when he's trapped in our little
        cube all by himself while I'm penned up in a meeting or
        conference, the poetic ranter returns. Today was such a
        day... and I want to </font><a

        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Todd often
        calls me a jerk, tries to trip me up by asking me what
        time it is while I'm wearing my candy watch, and swears
        that people at MEDITECH who don't know me call me,
        &quot;... that girl with the eyebrow ring.&quot; He
        understands the importance of eating lunch by the
        fountain and the magic of Jell-O and why I hate bees. He
        knows it's not a good idea to talk to me in the morning
        if he can't smell coffee on my breath and is a willing
        participant in experiments involving marshmallow bunnies
        or circus peanuts.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">This
        afternoon in Todd's car I pointed out the window and
        squealed at meaningless things that are important to me,
        like the 24-hour post office, and pedestrians turned to
        follow my hand and stared at me with a frightening
        wonder. And all the while Todd's expression never
        changed. Per usual, he shrugged his shoulders and kept us
        moving forward. And the comfort in his gesture was
        overwhelming and for a moment I knew how truly lucky I
        am.</font></p>
