        were knee deep in one of our surreal group meetings a few
        months ago, audience to yet another useless presentation.
        While Todd fought off the knee squeezing advances of the
        flirting presenter, I was bent over my copy of the agenda
        with a pencil, sketching and shading in the margins. When
        I sat back, Todd glanced over at the page, rolled his
        eyes, and laughed his best &quot;I'm-humoring-you&quot;
        laugh.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I had
        drawn a picture of a PC and underneath it, I wrote,
        &quot;I love HAL.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I can get
        slightly obsessive that way.</font></p>

        Dullea. And that gentle voice that always fills me with a
        conflict between comfort and fear: &quot;Good afternoon,
        gentlemen. I am a HAL 9000 computer. I became operational
        at the H.A.L. plant in Urbana, Illinois on the 12th of
        January 1992. My instructor was Mr. Langley, and he
        taught me to sing a song.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I made a
        HAL screen-saver that flashes his random mnemonics on my
        monitor when I ignore him for long stretches of time:
        &quot;VEH... ATM... LIF... NAV...&quot; It entertains
        Eric while he waits for his project to compile, eyes
        wondering toward my side of the room. It's my way of
        breathing life into this trusty machine... he's the
        frog for this princess to kiss.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">So imagine
        my surprise today when my PC began to emote...
        randomly... in the early morning hours while I sat in the
        semi-darkness watching the beginning of a reflected
        sunrise.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">HAL was
        emoting. He was connecting to me and explaining how he

        programmers... and at this moment I feel I could fall in
