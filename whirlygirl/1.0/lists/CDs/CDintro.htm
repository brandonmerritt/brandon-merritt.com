        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">My version
        of those ubiquitous year-end lists that consume our
        attention spans at the end of every year. My first html
        version of this list included a collage of each of the
        twenty-five artists on my list and the challenge to name
        them all. I think Ramona was the only one to try... and
        even she kept pointing at one of the guys and saying
        &quot;Bob Mould&quot;... even though he doesn't appear on
        my list. Hmmmm.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Now it's
        May 1999 when I'm throwing this new design together and I
        already regret some of my choices. I guess we never
        outgrow the embarrassment for who we are in that frozen
        moment of time... there in the past. We reinvent
        ourselves... pass through the person in that moment...
        our perspective changes. But like flipping through
        ancient snap-shots of the bodies we once inhabited, we
        should find some kind of peace revisiting the
        perspectives we once held.</font></p>
