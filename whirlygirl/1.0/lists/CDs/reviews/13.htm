        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial"><em>How It
        Feels to Be Something On</em> was touted by what seemed to
        be everyone before I finally had the will to pick it up.
        What more can be said than &quot;everyone&quot; was
        right. I'd never even heard of SDRE until developing a
        ravenous Dave Grohl obsession and suddenly this fall they
        became well-deserved indie-rock darlings. The mountains
        of sound in the title track and &quot;Roses in
        Water&quot; make the gentle, prodding melody that begins
        &quot;Guitar and Video Games&quot; even more remarkable.
        An extraordinarily well-rounded effort that demands your
        attention and does not disappoint. Kudos: Jeremy Enigk's
        layered vocals become the fifth instrument.</font></p>
