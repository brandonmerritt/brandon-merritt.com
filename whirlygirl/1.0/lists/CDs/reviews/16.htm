        entire album moved me as much as the first few breaths of
        &quot;Dying&quot;, ranking it #1 wouldn't be high enough.
        Unfortunately, for as many hits as <em>Celebrity Skin</em>
        contains, there are an equal number of misses. But when
        they're on, they are right on the money. &quot;Boys on
        the Radio&quot; and &quot;Heaven Tonight&quot; package
        the twists and turns that make the hair on my arms stand
        straight up. And I'm not one to resist the vacuous
        opening of the title track, claiming all the oxygen of
        your worst nuclear nightmare. I wouldn't trade these
        moments of brilliance for an entire album of &quot;good
        enough&quot;, but I've just been left hungry for more.
        Kudos: I can't get enough of Courtney and Melissa dishing
        all over Brian Warner.</font></p>
