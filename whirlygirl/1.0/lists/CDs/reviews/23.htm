        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">At the
        Paradise in May of 1996, Elvis Costello performed a new
        song that wasn't attached to his latest effort, <em>All
        This Useless Beauty</em>. He explained that the call he's
        waited for all his life had come: he'd been asked to
        collaborate with Burt Bacharach on a song for a film.
        That song, &quot;God Give Me a Strength&quot; was just
        the beginning of a perfect union. Costello, never afraid
        of running in a different direction (1993's <em>The Juliet
        Letters</em> with the Brodsky Quartet is proof enough),
        lends his heartbreaking voice and superior musicianship
        to what Bacharach is famous for: elaborate, heartfelt
        arrangements that border on easy listening. Kudos:
        Unpredictable melodies that melt in your ears.</font></p>
