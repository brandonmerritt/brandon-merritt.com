        songs are me on my darkest, most hopeless days, my
        brooding self finds them impossible to resist: pensive,
        sad, too honest, hard, reflective, sensitive, and filled
        with grief. Imagine yourself in your tiny apartment
        listening to &quot;The Longest Winter&quot;: &quot;Will
        you spend you whole life in a studio apartment? Are you
        stubborn to the core?&quot; Not to overlook the fact that
        it's fantastically musical as well, and not completely in
        a slow and minor-key vein. It took months to track down
        this gem in any local record shop, but well worth the
        wait. Kudos: It's not all a gloom and doom: &quot;When
        They Really Get to Know You They Will Run&quot; is all
        about girls who shave their legs.</font></p>
