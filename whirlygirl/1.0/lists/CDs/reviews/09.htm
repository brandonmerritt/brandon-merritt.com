        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Was it <em>Rolling
        Stone</em>? Was it <em>Spin</em>? Someone's end-of-the-year
        review appropriately said, &quot;If a nameless band
        dropped out of the sky and released <em>Up</em> they would
        be revered as gods of music.&quot; As it is, the band
        that did it has history and ridiculous expectations
        rendered impossible to live up to. I read the initial
        reviews claiming disaster. I received Harrington's email
        saying, &quot;I don't get it.&quot; But when it came to
        listening and evaluating <em>Up</em> for the first time, I
        took a deep breath and told myself: &quot;Think artistry.
        Think refinement. Think mystery. Just don't think
        R.E.M.&quot; It's all resulted in an unreserved passion
        for these songs, this bold direction, and their fearless
        individuality. Kudos: To continuing. Thanks.</font></p>
