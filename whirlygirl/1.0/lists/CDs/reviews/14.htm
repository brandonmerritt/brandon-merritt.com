        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Sometime
        in October, I was in Newbury Comics catching up on a
        backlog of Karate releases. The guy ringing up my
        purchases voiced his disappointment in Karate's <em>The
        Bed Is in the Ocean</em>, saying it was too much Geoff and
        not enough Karate. I said then and will say again,
        &quot;there is never too much Geoff Farina.&quot; Unique
        chord progressions, simplistic production, sheer poetry,
        and flawless musicianship are just a few of his assets.
        Quietly dramatic and passionately reserved, <em>Usonian
        Dream Sequence</em> showcases poignant songs and
        songwriting. Kudos: If only my writing could be as
        grounded and still as interesting. Magic.</font></p>
