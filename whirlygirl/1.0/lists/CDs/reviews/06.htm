        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I don't
        know how or why, but all the British music on this list
        makes me feel grown up. It's progressive. It's stylish.
        It's chic dinner parties in fashionable uptown
        brownstones wearing basic black. Cinerama is no exception
        to this rule. It's David Gedge's The Wedding Present
        minus the cocaine-fast guitars but with (thankfully) even
        more heartbreak, pain, anguish, and suffering. <em>Va Va
        Voom</em> is the soundtrack for every crush, relationship,
        and failed romance wrapped into 13 tracks. Makes a heart
        race to even think about it. Kudos: Brilliantly biting
        lyrics: &quot;And when I made that stupid oath/About how
        I was going to/Pay for someone to kill you both&quot;...
        You get the picture.</font></p>
