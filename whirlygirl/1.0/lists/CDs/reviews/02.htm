        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Imagine
        picking up a CD of a band you've never heard of simply
        because it strikes you. When you take it home, you unwrap
        it to reveal that, unbeknownst to you, your favorite
        author wrote the CD's liner notes. Since I can't hope to
        compose anything nearly as poetic to describe how much I
        love this album, an excerpt: &quot;I remember once
        reading that the most beautiful words in the English
        language are chime, lullaby and melody, and this sounds
        true to me. The words 'Saint Etienne' themselves give me
        a similar feeling - one of a world in which all the women
        wear pearls and are able to sing in key, and one where
        the men drive sportcars and never stumble - a world where
        nostalgia is beside the point because we all live inside
        a bright glorious present.&quot; Douglas Coupland</font></p>
