        27 November 1999</font></p>

        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Charm.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">This film
        gives off such an up-front, confrontational dose of
        charm. Matthew Lillard as Stevo speaks directly to you,
        sweeping you into his life, his friends, his attitude,
        his mantra. He suffocates you with this contagious
        enthusiasm. Injects you with his charm.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Watching
        this film is like following a writer through the process
        of creating characters and story. Each dive the director
        takes into pockets of background information and
        character development becomes a separate, enthralling
        story. Then suddenly fingers are snapped and the
        narrative moves forward, leaving you more entranced and
        committed than before. Pulled closer like a magnet. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Your
        unconscious investment leads to a handsome reward... a
        film that shades your perspective, leaves you drowning in
        self-reflection, and satiates your desire for something
        left of center. </font></p>
