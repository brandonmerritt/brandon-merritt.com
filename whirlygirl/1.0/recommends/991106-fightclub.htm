        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I've been
        driving around for days with the Pixies, &quot;Where is
        My Mind&quot; pouring out of my stereo at ear-bleeding
        decibel levels trying to puzzle together the images and
        ideas and turning points of this film with every spare
        minute. It's when a piece of art consumes me like this
        that I fully realize the poverty of language alone.
        Instead I want to paint with bold, thick acrylics on
        rugged canvas and turn up the volume so loud that your
        insides melt. And only then can I begin to make you
        understand.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I went
        into the theatre with little more than blind faith in
        Edward Norton and came out charged and changed by the
        sensory overload. Without a doubt, Norton is mesmerizing,
        particularly in portraying the depths of his stale and
        confused narrator against David Fincher's visually
        stunning atmosphere. Helena Bonham Carter's Marla Singer
        is equally interesting, her pale skin often washed in
        green hues of overhead fluorescent lighting conjuring a
        sickness and frailty that is indispensable to her
        character. Even Brad Pitt serves a brilliant purpose,
        bringing the necessary face and swagger to the role of
        Tyler Durden. Each performance is layered atop the other,
        creating an intricate weave of chaotic confusion.</font></p>

        skeptical, but don't be stupid. See this film.</font></p>
