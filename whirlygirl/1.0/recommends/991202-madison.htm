        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Initially
        it is the smoke rising from Helena Bonham Carter's
        cigarette, almost three dimensional within the confines
        of the overflowing magazine stand. My hands reach out
        immediately to touch it, the smoothest, taut paper, cool
        and metallic under my fingers. And then the magazine is
        in my hands and I'm paging through. And the only thing
        running through my mind:</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I love
        this paper.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">And then
        my eyes are engaged. White space framing clean, crisp
        text dressed in a simple, modern font. Photographs are
        expansive... they consume page after page, lulling me
        into a visual trance.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">And then I
        realize it.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Very few
        advertisements. A few whole page ads of stylistic photos
        in the beginning and end. Nothing in-between. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Nothing.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Just art.
        And stories. And ideas.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">No half
        page ads next to the articles. No stories continued on
        page 101, then page 246, then page... just so that they
        can fit in sprawling Tommy Hilfiger displays. Nothing
        that you would expect from a magazine. And instead,
        everything you've dreamed of.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">But don't
        let the style and design mask Madison's underlying value.
        The contributors ground their pieces in interesting
        subjects and lyrical language. Mark Mordue's poetry of
        travel and literature (July/August's &quot;A Sense of
        Place&quot;) showers me in rich textures and familiar
        thoughts. Luca Babini's interview with painter Francesco
        Clemente and the immediate photographs of his work
        (October's &quot;Sailing Uncharted Seas&quot;) put large
        and overflowing ideas in my head. Even something as
        simple as olives, when painted with Mort Rosenblum's
        experience and narrative (November/December's &quot;The
        Table: Olives&quot;), heighten my senses and awareness.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I don't
        always remember the artists or the books or the places
        long afterward, but in the moment, Madison transforms the
        way I see the world around me. It gives me ideas and
        leaves me with cravings for all things intricate and
        beautiful and interesting. Anxious for the next offering.
        Hungry for more.</font></p>
