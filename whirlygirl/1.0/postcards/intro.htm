        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">I was
        sitting with Michael in the bedroom of his small L.A.
        apartment, 9 months after the 1994 earthquake rendered
        destruction all around. It was a late night/early morning
        and the construction workers who
        spoke Spanish and flipped boxes of macaroni and cheese
        were due to wake us up in just a few hours. My trip was
        coming to an end.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">The
        postcards I had purchased in San Francisco were spread
        out before me. White matte postcards with tiny pictures
        of Coit Tower, the Golden Gate Bridge, and those quaint
        Victorian houses with the round windows. My experiences
        over the course of that week led me to write descriptive
        pieces of poetry, rather than the usual checklist of
        events. I closed my eyes, captured one moment, then
        affixed the stamp and sent it on its way.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Ever since
        then, I have seen postcards as the ideal medium. Small
        enough not to intimidate, magical enough to inspire,
        powerful enough to capture the new perspectives coupled
        with geographical upheaval.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">They hang
        from clothespins in my apartment. I stay up late after
        exhausting days in foreign places in order to create them
        for others. They mean more to me than you can imagine.</font></p>
