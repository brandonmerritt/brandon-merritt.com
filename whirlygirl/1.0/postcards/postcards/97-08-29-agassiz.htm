        <p><font color="#C0C0FF" size="2" face="Arial">Jack and Victoria have a picturesque mezzanine writing room off the
stairwell’s first landing with unfathomable panes of glass that,
during the day provide a remarkable view over the Frasier River
Valley. I would sit in there late at night, posting
letters to friends, reading Alain de Botton, and dreaming . It wasn’t
unusual for me to find Jack standing in the doorway with his evening
glass of Merlot in hand, watching me with silent interest for extended
periods of time. I pretended not to notice him night after night,
playing along with the game of voyeurism he created soon after my
arrival. Each night I would casually clear a spot on the chaise lounge
next to me, welcoming him to sit, though he never moved past the
doorway. We never spoke a word, never even acknowledged the other’s
presence. I maintained undistracted interest in my letter, my book, my
quiet meditation, all the while avoiding his heavy gaze, the way the
left side of his mouth turned up in the slightest of smiles, the
resulting heat that circulated around the room.</p>
<p>As quickly as this game became a routine, Jack changed the rules.
One evening in late July, he pulled himself away from the inertia of
the doorway and into the unknown of the seat next to me. My mind
frantically searched for tangibles; hints as to how to play this
changing game. I pretended not to notice his long fingers tracing
lightly over where my tousled hairline met the nape of my neck. I
became overly aware of my trembling hands, an overturned wine glass,
and our eyes locking for the first time after more than a month of
similar circumstances. I could hear Jack and Victoria’s son,
Joshua, shift his sleeping weight in the room beyond the wall
behind us. My breath was sharp and audible. The left corner of his
mouth upturned still. I closed my eyes and felt him shift on the
chaise. When I opened them again, he was gone. I felt the warm wine
beneath my right foot, seeping deeper into the Oriental rug.</font></p>
