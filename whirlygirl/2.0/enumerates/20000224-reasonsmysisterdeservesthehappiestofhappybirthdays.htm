<h1>sixteen reasons my sister deserves the happiest of happy birthdays</h1>
<h2>24 February 2000</h2>

<p>Her utter selflessness and &uuml;ber generosity</p>

<p>Forever the brave and valiant mediator between me and mom</p>

<p>When she accidently threw my purse out the car window while going 70mph
on the highway, she backed up to look for it. When we couldn't find it,
she bought me a new one and even replaced the money in my wallet.</p>

<p>When I was younger, she actually liked shopping for me better than shopping for herself.</p>

<p>Her tequila drinking impresses my lush friends.</p>

<p>She dreams in more digital detail than LucasFilm.</p>

<p>Inviting endless streams of my junior high and high school friends into her home without the
least bit of fuss</p>

<p>The time we outran the cops on I77 South</p>

<p>Keeping me included in her daily routine, even after her children were born</p>

<p>Her cheese potatoes are never cold.</p>

<p>The way she scrunches up her face and gets all teary when I make her laugh</p>

<p>Unpredictable weekends at Grandma's house</p>

<p>She's the &quot;good aunt&quot; who didn't poke Hannah in the eye.</p>

<p>Her impeccable sense of direction and confidence in going places</p>

<p>Her rapid-fire way of telling any story to make you feel like &quot;YOU ARE THERE&quot;</p>

<p>Those tiny pats on my back when she gives me a hug</p>
