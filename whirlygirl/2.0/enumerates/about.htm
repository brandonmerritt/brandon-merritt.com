        his conversation is simply enumeration: if he has seen a
        good film, he will not describe the plot, or how it made
        him feel, but where it ranks in his best-of-year list,
        his best-of-all-time list, his best-of-decade list-- he
        thinks and talk in tens and fives, and as a consequence,
        Dick and I do too. And he makes us write lists as well,
        all the time: 'Okay, guys. Top five Dustin Hoffman
        films.' Or guitar solos, or records made by blind
        musicians, or Gerry and Sylvia Anderson shows ('I don't
        believe you've got Captain Scarlet at number one, Dick.
        The guy was immortal! What's fun about that?'), or sweets
        that come in jars ('If either of you have got Rhubarb and
        Custard in the top five, I'm resigning now.')&quot;</font></p>
