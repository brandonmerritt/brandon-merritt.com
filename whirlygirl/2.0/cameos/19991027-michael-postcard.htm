<h2>cameo appearance by Michael Timmons<br>27 October 1999</H2>


<p>I just had a David Lynch moment. I had just dropped a postcard to
you in the mail and had gone back to the lobby in the
building where I work.</p>

<p>:: DING ::</p>

<p>The elevator door opened. I entered. I was followed by a man
wearing a huge jacket, like the suit David Byrne wore in <em>Stop
Making Sense</em>. I pressed 20 for my floor. The man
pressed no buttons. He seemed very confident, so I
assumed that he was going to the 20th floor, too.</p>

<p>When the lights flashed on floor 17, the man who had been very
still quickly slapped the button for 18. The doors opened
for the 18th floor.</p>

<p>I said, &quot;Wow! That was close.&quot;</p>

<p>He looked back at me and said in a French accent, &quot;It's a
dangerous game.&quot; And got out.</p>
