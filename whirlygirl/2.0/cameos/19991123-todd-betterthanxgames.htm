<h1>better than x games</h1>

<h2>cameo appearance by Todd Sonneborn<br>23 November 1999</h2>


<p>It would be hard not to notice the recent trend toward alternative
sports. Competitions like the X-Games and the Gravity
Games now celebrate sports like sky surfing, street luge,
bike vert, snowboarding big air, speed climbing, and
skier slopestyle. People got bored with the endless rules
and lack of creativity in traditional sports like
baseball and football. Can you blame them? </p>

<p>In our cubicle we've taken this notion a step farther...
probably too far (as I'm prone to do), but that's what
traditional sports needed and exactly what cubes need
too. A little out-of-the-box thinking keeps things
&quot;balanced&quot;. Kristen wrote about the <a
href="../wonders/19990906-thecube-index.htm" target="bottom"
onmouseover="self.status='our geekosphere...';return true";
onmouseout="self.status='whirlygirl';return true";>stuff visitors see in our cube</a>: the toys,
marshmallow bunnies and the like... decorations which
make &quot;the cube&quot; a little less square.</p>

<p>As whirlygirl's main content provider, Kristen's
claim-to-fame, highly visual learning/thinking/writing
style overlooks some of the greatest cube-relief stuff in
our little &quot;cubey&quot; lives here. That's where I
(today's guest lecturer, cameo appearer, substitute
teacher, or whatever I'm called) come in. I must (just
this once) defend Kristen and her visually-intensive
thinking... it is not flawed for her eyes to miss the
below list of ridiculous games and contests. Much of this
stuff is done in such a way that it specifically evades
optic nerves, something that's second nature to anyone
who's worked in a cubicle before.</p>

<p>The rules to all games are painfully simple, but the strategies and
execution can be developed into a true art-form. These
contests may be adopted into the X-Games next millennium,
and I assure you that Gold and Silver are already spoken
for.</p>

<h3>HIDE THE MUSTARD</h3>

				mustard on your opponent's half of the
				cube.</td>

				<td valign="top">Strategies:</td>
				<td valign="top">More packets = fun.<br>
				More time passing without finding mustard
				= more fun.<br>
				Tape them to the inside of your
				opponent's closed umbrella = most fun.<br>
				Hiding packets in places with high
				tear/break/burst risk = don't even joke
				about it.</td>

				Don't let them see

				it in very ornate lettering. More ornate
