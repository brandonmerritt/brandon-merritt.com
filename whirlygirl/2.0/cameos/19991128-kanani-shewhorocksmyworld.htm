<h1>she who rocks my world</h1>

<h2>cameo appearance by Lucinda Kanani Lloyd Harvey<br>28 November 1999</h2>


<p>It seems that time always eludes me when I need it
most.&nbsp;Forever just within my grasp, but standing in
line behind something else more determined to be
first.&nbsp; Whenever I do get a chance to read, I always
have a sleepless night. That's not bad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The passing of hours and hours of darkness, when the rest of
the house is quiet, has produced thoughts and revelations
that follow me still.&nbsp;I thought I would share
something with you.</p>

<p>I had always heard that there isn't a love anywhere as deep and
abiding as a mother's love for a child.&nbsp;And I always
thought that was something out of a greeting card or
someone's imagination, until I had Madison. She rocks my
world.</p>

<p>She knows my faults and loves me still.&nbsp;I am the most
important person in her life and she in mine.&nbsp;She
always has time for me, even though sometimes I don't
have time for her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She snuggles into the bed on a chilly Saturday morning and
lets me sleep for 5 more minutes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She thinks I am the smartest person in the world, especially when I
explain to her that electricity is what makes Sesame
Street work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She passes out kisses and hugs on request and for no reason other
that she wanted to.&nbsp;Sometimes, she holds my hand
just because.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She always speaks the truth, especially when I don't want to hear
it. Sometimes, when I see the world through her eyes, I
am amazed and sometimes, I am ashamed.</p>

<p>More than anything, I am overwhelmed by the enormity of my role in
her life and how that will shape her future, yet she
trusts me completely and has no inclination to change
that fact in any way. She will be what she will be
because I am her mother.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Children are the soul of the world.&nbsp;Honesty is their backbone
and love is their motto, they are the purest thing in the
world.&nbsp;They have no preconceived notion of hate, of
racism or of all the things that are wrong in the
world.&nbsp;They love with absolute abandon.&nbsp;What
we, as adults, do and say now will reverberate in their
young lives for years and years to come.</p>

<p>All of us have heard one adult accuse another adult of acting like
a child.&nbsp;Is that a bad thing?&nbsp; Maybe all would
be right with the world if we did.</p>

<p>We can learn a lot from children.&nbsp;Maybe we should listen a
little more and talk a little less.</p>
