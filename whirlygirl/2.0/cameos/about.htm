<h1>cameos</h1>

<p>L.A. Michael and I won't speak for months and then suddenly
he'll call out of the blue and what ensues is a three to
four hour telephone conversation that mimics a winding
road, with Technicolor surprises around each corner. And
the images that appear to him in dreams and the ideas
that tumble over and over in his mind... are inspiring.</p>

<p>I think almost everyone at some time or another feels like
they're sitting in the quiet, motionless epicenter of a
storm, while the talent and creativity and insight of
friends rage on all around them. The pieces of me that
string together to make this site are completely
dependent on the gifts that my raging friends grant me.
And with their permission, I share them with you.</p>
