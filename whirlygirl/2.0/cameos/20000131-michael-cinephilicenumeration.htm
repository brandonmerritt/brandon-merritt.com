<h1>cinephilic enumeration</h1>

<h2>cameo appearance by [L.A.] Michael Timmons<br>
31 January 2000</h2>

<p>I am guilty. I am a cinephile. I love movies and I obsess over
them way too much. I, like everyone else in the city of angels (a
deceiving name if there ever was one), am trying to break in to
&quot;the biz&quot;. I'm in the process of acting. I could write
volumes on this alone, but I'll try not to digress. If you are
wondering if you have seen me in anything, you may have, but
these are not significant acting bits for me to brag about. I am,
however, a member of the Screen Actor's Guild and this is where
my little article really begins.</p>

<p>I'm sure that you have become aware of the increasing amount
of awards shows that are televised each year, i.e. The Emmy's,
The MTV Video Music Awards, The Grammy's, The NAACP Image Awards,
People's Choice, The Golden Globes, The ESPN Awards, The Country
Music Awards, The Tony's, The Academy Awards, The Nickelodeon
Awards, The Screen Actor's Guild Awards, and the Best Awards Show
Awards. Ok, the last one is made up, but there are many more I
could have added to that list. Let me talk in particular about
the Screen Actor's Guild Awards, which recognizes actors in film
and television. Each year SAG creates a committee of about 2,000
members by randomly selecting from the names of its 98,000 active
members. The odds of getting struck by lightning are probably
better than the odds of getting onto the SAG Nominating Committee
(SAG Nom Comm).</p>

<p>Well lightning struck in my favor this year, as I was one of
the lucky ones to get chosen for the Film division. Last
September, I received a special SAG Nom Comm Card which basically
entitled me and a guest to attend special screenings of movies at
the various studios and at regular
theatres. On top of that, studios began mailing me special
screening tapes of movies that were currently in theatres or that
hadn't even been released yet. This cinephile/struggling actor was
like a kid in a candy store.</p>

<p>I began to see films like the world was going to end. I also
couldn't wait to get home to see what Santa/the postman had left
in my stocking/mailbox. I was the envy of other actors. I was a
hero to my friends and neighbors to whom I lent the screening
tapes. My attitude at the beginning was, &quot;Cool, it's free...
I don't care if it sucks.&quot; I was taking my &quot;job&quot;
very seriously. Too seriously. I studied each film making sure to
evaluate each actor, so that I could be fair in my voting.</p>

<p>And then it happened.</p>

<p>I had seen one too many films. I overloaded. I became greedy.
I began to wait for the films to arrive in the mail instead of
going to see them in a theatre. I waited... I expected. I waited
to see <em>Boy's Don't Cry</em> because I thought, &quot;Surely
I'm going to get it in the mail.&quot; I was wrong. By the time I
had to submit my nominations, I had received over 40 films on
tape from every studio except Fox, Warner Brothers, and Disney. I
was like a spoiled brat. Like Veruca Salt in <em>Willy Wonka and
the Chocolate Factory</em>, &quot;I want a copy of <em>Fight Club</em>
and I want it NOWWWWWW!&quot; I began thinking evil thoughts
like, &quot;Well if Disney doesn't care enough to send us lowly
actors a screening tape of <em>The Sixth Sense</em>, then I don't
care enough to vote for Haley Joel Osment in the Supporting Actor
category!&quot; It was bad.</p>

<p>I also began to understand the minds of film critics.
I used to think that they were, at times, snotty and pretentious.
But suddenly, it all clicked. Film critics see too many damn
films. They become jaded. They want something new, exciting,
invigorating. Studios recycle the same stories, stars, locations,
and camera angles. I got to the point where I wanted something
more.</p>

<p>1999 was a unique year for film. Nothing really had a major
impact like, <em>The English Patient</em> or <em>The Godfather</em>
or <em>Schindler's List</em>. There were a lot of good movies.
This seemed to be the year of films with unlikable characters or
characters that had very little or no redeeming qualities. What
do I mean? See <em>American Beauty</em>, <em>Fight Club</em>, <em>The
Talented Mr. Ripley</em>, <em>Magnolia</em>, or <em>The End of the
Affair.</em> Most of the characters in these films were either
repressed, obsessed, or depressed. But that doesn't mean that
these were bad movies; on the contrary, they were some of the
best. And there was a lot of great acting.</p>

<p>All of the joking above aside, I was really grateful to be a
voice in this years SAG awards. Initially, I was nervous about
choosing. In the beginning, I thought I was only able to choose
one actor per category. Later I was relieved to discover that I
was able to choose 5 actors per category. And even though I was
as diligent as possible, I was still unable to see a bunch of
movies. I felt guilty for turning in my ballot without seeing, <em>Boy's
Don't Cry</em>, <em>The Cradle Will Rock</em>, <em>Anna and the
King</em>, <em>The Limey</em>, and a few others.</p>

<p>Ok, enough rambling! I know that some of my nominees wouldn't
make it to the final ballot (they'll actually be <a

how I voted.</p>

<h3>actor</h3>

    <tr>
        <td>Russell Crowe...<em>The Insider</em><br>
        Philip Seymour Hoffman... <em>Flawless</em><br>
        Anthony Hopkins... <em>Titus</em><br>

        Meryl Streep... <em>Music of the Heart</em><br>
        Sigourney Weaver... <em>A Map of the World</em></td>

        Chris Cooper... <em>American Beauty</em><br>
        Jude Law... <em>The Talented Mr. Ripley</em><br>
        Harry Lennix... <em>Titus</em><br>
        Haley Joel Osment... <em>The Sixth Sense</em></td>

        <em>Titus</em></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3>my predictions</h3>

<table border="0">
    <tr>
        <td>Anything from <em>Titus</em> will be overlooked...
        and Julianne Moore will get a nomination or multiple
        nominations (the ratio is too high... she was in 4,339
        movies this year, plus she is one talented actress).</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>The actor category was really hard for me. I was juggling with
Jim Carrey, Matt Damon, Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Russell
Crowe among a few others.</p>

<h3>my top 10 films of 1999</h3>

        <td valign="top">WB tried to fool audience goers with ads
        that led one to believe the movie was about sex. It's
        about obsession. The performances are superb. Tom Cruise
        is getting recognition for his acting in Magnolia, but
        her is much better here.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="30%">8. <em>Never Been Kissed</em></td>
        <td valign="top">It's like an 80's movie... Drew
        Barrymore is very charming.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="30%">7. <em>Southpark: Bigger,
        Longer &amp; Uncut</em></td>
        <td valign="top">I laughed so hard and I wasn't a fan of
        the Southpark TV Show.</td>

        <td valign="top">Shakespeare would approve.</td>

    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="30%">4. <em>Being John Malkovich</em></td>
        <td valign="top">The most unique film of the past few
        years. I hope it wins an Oscar for best original
        screenplay.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="30%">3. <em>Fight Club</em></td>
        <td valign="top">Douglas Coupland mixed with Brett Easton
        Ellis. Exciting, brilliant, and mentally challenging. Not
        for the weak at heart.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="30%">2. <em>American Beauty</em></td>
        <td valign="top">This will probably win the Oscar.</td>

    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="30%">1. <em>Magnolia</em></td>
        <td valign="top">Some say it's three hours about deeply
        depressed people, no plot, and frogs. I say bravo!</td>

<p>Well, now that my &quot;job&quot; is done, I don't know what
I'm going to do with myself.</p>
