<h1>my monday</h1>

<h2>cameo appearance by Laine Thomas<br>8 November 1999</h2>


<p>How is my monday?&nbsp; Odd.</p>

<p>Dana (my teen friend) spent the night last night because Marion
(co-worker) is out of town on business.&nbsp; We ordered
in Chinese, switched my shoes from summer to winter, and
watched <i>the Practice</i>.&nbsp; This morning I got up
and drove her to school, after throwing on some warm-up
pants and a hooded sweatshirt.&nbsp; And as I waited in
line, behind mini vans and SUVs, I had a flash of an
alternative path, a life that could be someday.&nbsp; I
felt like I was in an episode of <i>Once and Again</i>,
only not as pretty as Sela Ward.&nbsp; Then, I wished
Dana a good day, drove back home to get dressed for work
in my turtleneck, cardigan, long skirt and tough black
boots - and I was me again.&nbsp; An aimless single
woman, one who didn't really crave that life glimpsed,
but could see how easy it would be to slip into, like a
pair of warm-up pants and a hooded sweatshirt.</p>
