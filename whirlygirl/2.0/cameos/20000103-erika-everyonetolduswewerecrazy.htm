<h1>everyone told us we were crazy</h1>

<h2>cameo appearance by Erika Frey<br>3 January 2000</h2>

<p>Just before 1pm on December 31, 1999, Lisa and I arrived at
Penn Station in New York City. We stopped at a little
kiosk to pick up glittering &quot;Happy 2000&quot;
headbands and glow-in-the-dark &quot;2000&quot; glasses
and made our way to the infamous Times Square
celebration. The sidewalks were brimming with shoppers
and tourists, but it did not look like an unusual NYC
day. The closer we got to Times Square, the more blue
NYPD barriers lined the streets. Finally, the sidewalk
traffic stopped. The police were diverting people around
the area. We went by blockade after blockade until
finally we reached one of the streets where the public
was allowed to enter the square. All the other side
streets were empty and required special permission to
pass through. We went down what I believe was 46th street
and could see some festivities going on in the square.
Once we reached the square, we hit more barriers and were
told to keep moving. At this point, people were jumping
over and ducking under barricades despite what the Police
were saying. We found a fence like barrier with some bars
missing so you could squeeze through. The police office
nearby said that he wasn't going to stop us, so we
squeezed into the viewing area right next to the Marriott
Marquis Hotel.</p>

<p>It was the perfect spot as we could see the countdown ball and
various TV screens as well as having a great view of the
little stage set up for the performers. Our neighbors
included a group of about 10 from Tennessee, a couple
Belgians, Austrians, Italians, a Brit and his southern
girlfriend, lots of college kids, etc. I would estimate
the percentage of actual New Yorkers being in the single
digits. Lisa and began to settle in for the 11 hour wait.</p>

<p>Luckily, there was some entertainment going on throughout the day.
Fifteen minutes before the hour, the celebration would
begin for the next time zone to cross into the Year 2000.
It typically involved music, some sort of parade, dancing
and, of course, the countdown and confetti. The
highlights were the GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) New Year
where they threw down sparkly silver confetti and played
&quot;All you need is love&quot; by the Beatles, and the
GMT-2 where they put on a big Brazilian showcase and
threw down butterfly confetti. The confetti was half the
show - we had streamers, paper curly Qs, round paper,
silver foil, snowflakes, butterflies and giant globe
balloons which got bounced around like beach balls. On the
screens, they showed the fireworks from Moscow, Athens,
Paris, Rio. The most boring time zone was GMT-1 which was
for 2 sets of Atlantic islands and they had people
dancing around Macintosh raincoats pretending to be in a
boat. Each celebration lasted 25-30 minutes, so we had to
find something to do the rest of time. Believe it or not,
I brought a book to read. I can't say that I saw anyone
else reading a book. Boy did I look cool.</p>

<p>There was occasional entertainment provided by the crowd as well.
One of the college kids, a guy with a shaved head named
Joe, started off with a Canadian baseball cap and sucking
down a bottle of eggnog. After a few more drinks, the
head attire turned into two Scooby Doo party hats over
his ears and a bright yellow plastic Happy New Year hat.
Every 10 minutes or so, he would cry out,
&quot;Yippee!&quot;. Around 8 or 9pm, he tried crowd
surfing but didn't get very far. Some other guy kept
pushing threw the crowd with a small entourage claming to
be Tom Green (from the MTV show which I have never seen
so I'm not even sure if that's the right name). One of
the Tennessee ladies would also occasionally shout out
something in a southern drawl and then cackle. Other than
these few characters, the crowd was fairly tame. There
was an occasional push and shove from people trying to go
to the PortaPotties, and there was one pickpocket type
guy who was quickly extracted by the police (only to
return 20 minutes later). Other than that, the rowdiest
behavior occurred during the fierce competition for cool
confetti and free stuff that was being thrown out into
the crowd.</p>

<p>The police were being pretty strict about turning people away, so
the crowd never got much bigger than it was when we
arrived at 1pm. Many people returning from the toilets
gave reports of arguments with the police trying to get
back into the viewing area. The realization hit us that
we would not be able to get food without risking a border
crossing. The possibility of getting lost or not being
able to return was too great a fear for Lisa and I, so we
made it through the night with just 2 apples and 3 drink
boxes between us.</p>

<p>As the hour of truth approached, helicopters started flying
overhead probably to check for those snipers that Jeanne
had described. People were calling loved ones on their
cell phone perhaps for the last time.</p>

<p>There was no big build up to the GMT-5 New Year. No dancers and no
parade. Just a 15 minute and 5 minute warning from the
Discover Card screen. And then the big countdown started
on the screen - 59...58...57......3...2...1... - the
crowd exploded into one big roar, champagne was rocketing
out of hundreds of bottles, and there was so much
confetti swirling around that I could hardly make out the
big &quot;2000&quot; which had lit up where the ball had
disappeared. Everyone was hugging, shaking hands, and
sharing the champagne. And then it was over.</p>

<p>Now we had to get out. The barricades on the side streets were still
up so the crowd going out of the square bottle necked
into the two spaces left open at the sidewalk. Plus we
had to battle against the people standing at the
barricade who were watching or wanting to get in. There
was one other incident where the police had stopped
people from crossing the street so that they could move
along their buses full of trouble makers. There was more
squishing and pushing on that corner than there ever was
in the square. Lisa and I got squashed against a
newspaper stand, but once that was cleared, it was
smoothly sailing all the way to Penn Station. We caught
the 12:50am train back to NJ. The traffic out of NY the
next day was very light.</p>
